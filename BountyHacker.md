Find open ports on the machine.

First of all we’ll need to find open ports on our target machine, but if you are beginner you’ll literally think what’s a port or port number, for them here is a little explanation about port number.

    Port: Ports are nothing but unique numbers which is assigned to many services running on your system to identify them on network. For example your firefox browser running on port something 5543.

    To check which ports running on your windows system , just run cmd as administrator and run below command:

    netstat -b

Now come to the question, find open ports, so for this we will use a nmap tool which is used for port scanning , helps us to find open ports n all, so let’s see what are the open ports on our target.

nmap -sV -sT -sU -A target_ip

    sV: This flag/option is used for version detection .
    -sT: TCP port scan
    -sU: UDP port scan
    -A: OS detection

But here -sV is enough to find open ports and services required to escalate, so let’s do it:

nmap -sV -sC target_ip

Here you can see 21,22,80 ports are open so why not to connect using ftp with target machine because anonymous login is allowed it means anyone can connect with the server using ftp, so let’s do it.

    Note: FTP is a file transfer protocol which runs on port 21 and used for the transfer of computer files between a client and server in a network via port 21.

What service can you bruteforce with the text file found?

ssh


What is the users password? 

For this we’ll bruteforce user’s pasword with the help of lock.txt wordlist and hydra tool.
