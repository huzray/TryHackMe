- What port number has a web server with a CMS running? *8000*
- What is the username we can find in the CMS? *Bolt*
- What is the password we can find for the username? *boltadmin123*
- What version of the CMS is installed on the server? (Ex: Name 1.1.1) *Bolt 3.7.1*
- There's an exploit for a previous version of this CMS, which allows authenticated RCE. Find it on Exploit DB. What's its EDB-ID? *48296*
- Metasploit recently added an exploit module for this vulnerability. What's the full path for this exploit? (Ex: exploit/....)
Note: If you can't find the exploit module its most likely because your metasploit isn't updated. Run `apt update` then `apt install metasploit-framework`
*exploit/unix/webapp/bolt_authenticated_rce*
- Set the LHOST, LPORT, RHOST, USERNAME, PASSWORD in msfconsole before running the exploit *No answer needed*
- Look for flag.txt inside the machine. *THM{wh0_d035nt_l0ve5_b0l7_r1gh7?}*
