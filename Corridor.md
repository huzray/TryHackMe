### Escape the Corridor

You have found yourself in a strange corridor. Can you find your way back to where you came?  

In this challenge, you will explore potential IDOR vulnerabilities. Examine the URL endpoints you access as you navigate the website and note the hexadecimal values you find (they look an awful lot like aÂ _hash_, don't they?). This could help you uncover website locations you were not expected to access.

  
What is the flag?
Where do those doors take you? The numbers and letters seem to follow a pattern...
